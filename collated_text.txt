I have been using this earphone from last 2 months in my redmi 3s prime. While using this earphone, All the time I am using in-built audio player of my phone in headphone mode. As a result the out put sound of this earphone is very balanced, vocals , bass , high mids and lows are also equally balanced. 

BASS king bt Vocals are average...bt w8 let me clear a thing,,a earphone with great bass can be tuned to crispy vocals (using a good equalizer) bt a earphone lacking hardware for grt bass cannot e.g., Sennheiser cx series...after using it for around half year I would say these are better

Best part is this packaging was as same as there 2000rs earphones. They didn't compromise with packaging. It was superb. You get earphones in a metal box with carrying case, extra size earbuds, some stickers

I love how good this is at noise canceling. The sound quality is just too good. Never thought a 500rs headphones can be this good. The bass as well is amazing. You get this in a nice little box with a sheet of stickers you can put on your phone or other devices. You also get different sizes of ear buds. There’s a rubbery loop which you can put under to prevent headphones from falling out of the ear. Very good feature since I always hated headphones like this because of how frequently they fell out.

The product I received was the best in ear phones. I have used JBL, Senheiser, Boat, Beats, Philips, Remax and a few more. Though I was compromised with performance.. but the ANT AUDIO is the one which satisfied my desire for the search of BASS HEAD EAR PHONES. Absolute Noise Cancellation, High Definition Sound Quality with any music android music playe

I am writing this review after one month of usage. Oh man! What a sound.T his is literally feeling like in heaven. This one beats every other in ear earphones available in the market in terms of Bass. No other ear phone matches the sound quality alongside huge thumping bass they are allowed to produce.If you want an earphone with high bass but not compromising on sound quality ,then this is the one for you. This beats Boat 225 in terms of sound quality whereas both stands equal in Bass terms.

Earbuds keep falling out of ear even when walking forget going running with these on. It has issues with mic as well as the person on other side can't hear me properly. This piece is of no use for me , you seller/ Amazon why would you give me an option to get the same piece again instead of refund. 

Worst Product Ever !!! First Time I Got Earphone Broken from one side. Then When I applied for Replacement ...I got It Next Day after My Request and One Side Stopped Working After 10 days

You won't be able to use this for one month. Very low build quality. Earpiece broke when I tried to change buds. Mic is not working in laptop. Trust me, don't buy this.

I bought this costly headset for almost 600+ rupees but it didn't satisfy my expectations. Even it didn't satisfy common expectations. I used it while playing Pubg, it totally sucked. Because no one else can hear me speaking through it. The microphone is not good in receiving my audio. 

Bass is loud and clear. Sound quality is not bad but the pain is intense for me.


The sound is really good nice and punchier bass durability is amazing for ruf use I play Pubg a lot on it and must say the surround sound you can easily spot ememy lisent music and stream YouTube videos it's very good in fact amazing on this earphones no pain no nothing I am giving this review after 9 months of usage and still going on good I am not promoting this product it's just feedback for to decide for others to buy this this earphones or not enjoy .

I gave overall rating 4 because they have mentioned that we will receive the earphones in metal box but I received in a damaged paper box!!! Earphones is actually really good... It's worth one I have been using it for almost 1month and there is no issue

I never.felt to use any equalizer because sound quality is super. Material quality is also good wires are hard and if you can see it will be well for ears those who have problem that earphones does not.fit to ears.just forget and try this. At last trending pubg sound quality is also good and clear. Durable I'm not supposed to tell this because using since few days only.

Please don’t buy this as it stopped working after couple of months. 

bought this inear for Rs 600. In this range this earphone is surprisingly amazing. The sound quality is great even in highs. I wonder that any other brand offer noise cancellation in this range. The noise cancellation is around 60-70%, but is great for me that I’m not completely isolated from this planet. Only problem I met is comfort. The earphone is not sitting well inside my ears. Also getting little ear pain.

good sound quality,
great design,
better material.
it comes in a metal box with a pouch and extra 2 pairs of different sized buds.
only this I dont understand is why those 2 hanger type arrangement to the earphones, which is little uncomfortable.
Rest of the things are very nice as I mentioned earlier.
Previously I used Boat 220 for almost 2years, with which I was fully satisfied. Now this set is also exactly the same design with even better quality of sound. So I dont find any Negatives to mention. I hope this set will also be as durable as my earlier one.
Thank you!

These earphones are priced high, worth is not more than Rs 400.00. They have good sound quality, no noise cancelation, but the bass quality is good. If there is a lightening deal and drops by Rs 150.00 then you should buy not one but ,the other for backup. The earphones do not fall out of the ear.

I read the reviews before buying but still went for the product. Many of the reviews told that the left earpiece got problems within weeks of use. For me the same issue happened.

Fake alert. This seems to be a fake product with bad packaging and bad design

The product came in a very well packing. Seller provides gift stickers which are pretty cool. The quality of the product is really good. The sound quality you get at this price is incomparable to any other brand. Its a must buy earphones for all the people who likes to listen to the high end songs with crystal clear bass. I just simply loved this product. Five Stars

I was hesitant to order it first as i was not aware of the brand Ant Audio.
I am glad i ordered these headphones.
Superb built quality, with better sound (bass). I dont even have to keep it on full volume.
Earbuds feel a bit heavy for the ears if you are hearing music or watching movies for longer time
The Audio Controls work perfectly with my Iphone 8+ but gives me some trouble with MI A1, the next or previous track selection doesnt work. I didn't test it with any other android mobile.
Call receive/disconnect works fine on both mobiles. Sound is crystal clear. Overall happy with these.
No other issues as of now.

One side of the earphones stopped working. Pathetic quality

The product is too good. The quality of earphone is Awsome. I'm used this earphone in a rough manner but it didn't damaged. The wire quality is superb, almost it doesn't get tangled. 

Great build quality of the wire and definitely it is tangle free..!! Packaging by with Amazon and the Ant Audio casing was great. The box, the three earpieces, the earphones, the warranty card, the stickers are truly great...!! The price is just 600/-. I mean its really really cheap for such an amazing set of earphones....!! Don’t think twice before buying it....just go for it...!!

Simply i will say if you want an earphone for a very long run then just go for it. Cuz if an earphone sounds insane but have poor built quality then there is no sense. Also its sound quality is good and the bass is also there and you will feel the bass when there is need not like other earphones which produces bass all time without any need. Sound of these earphones is balanced and the built quality is insane.

Slippy from ears always

These have good sound quality and properly catch beats but the worst thing about this is noise cancellation....

Warranty claim is a hectic procedure. It takes 5-6 days to get warranty claim approval itself. After approval, Customer is supposed to send product to service centre at their own cost. Don't know how much time may take to repair or replace and then shipping back to customer.

Only music is hearing not the voice.

The left earbud stopped working after 2 days got it exchange

right ear phone fluttering, only the ''right'' earphone , when connected to laptop and listening to bass tracks(bass is why i got this is for), besides received the main metal container after it has gone through multiple dents! kindly give care for packaging amazon! that would be deeply appreciated!!

That's no bass and loss my money this product worst bass clearity

Sound quality is awesome but not for sports

not able to hear any voices in the right earbuds. and the sound is muffled.after just 15 days of daily use. very bad quality.

I order ant W56 on 26th DEC 2018 from Amazon flash sale for 499 RS. I listened indhira logathu song from 2.O (a tamil movie) in musicolet app.(we can boost bass in this app) probably, you guys know that, we usually check the quality of any headset with Rahman songs only (even we

If you face any problem with the headset you are on your own. There is no support or service facility available in India. I myself couriered the product to their said service centre in Delhi but there was nothing from their side. The phone number is also inactive. Otherwise the product is good in terms of bass and overall quality.

This earphone has sound and bass of very good quality,but durability is really very low.One earphone stopped working correctly only in few weeks.Would never buy this again.

Not fit in ear

Bad

Sounds great and bass quality is also good. But the build quality is just ok. Better one is boats I think. The left side earplug starts crackling and cutting sound whenever the wire is shakes or the connector shakes. Need replacement of product.
If the new one feels good experience sure I will re edit the review

Voice clarity is Good but it does not fit in ear properly. Speakers fall down due to its heavy weight wire.

I brought this after reading so many reviews. (Wanted to try a new brand of audio, before i used Harman JBL) Before even testing sound quality, the earphones didn't fit perfectly for my mobile (HONOR PLAY). I DONT THINK THAT IT IS EXACT 3.5MM. So had to return it the next day. From the experience i have had.. Sound quality is good. Ok bass. Comfort not so good. Compatability with mobile is worst. Hope they improve their quality.

I don't recommend

Buds are low qualit.

Nice but vocals not clear

i used to get pain in ears or some irritation if i continuously use the above headset. (i never used boat brand headset. so i don't know about that). personally i have recommended w56.

Sounds good but it lasted only 5 months one side not working now and im a gamer i did use headset a lot but still didn't expect it to get damaged this quick

Built quality is not that worthy. Nd even mike does not work properly

After 20 days of usage, i lost one earhook as they are not perfectly sticked. There is nothing to do because you can't put in your ear without earhook. You can't buy it online or offline, i have tried a lot.
So if you can't put it back in the case after every usage, just don't buy it.
P. S. - I've lost second one too so if anyone knows what to do please let me know.

Edited:- After one year of rough uses, I'm writing this. Earphones, cable or jack is working perfectly. There is same music experience after one year.

Overall the earphone is okay okay, the treble and vocals are balanced but if you want bass then it is not sufficient for bass.

Sounds quality is good but one side stopped working in a month like wtf! Another problem is with the mic....have to hold in really close and i mean really close to talk to someone / for voice commands.

Nah I'm buying realme buds 2. After 1 year the audio jack is messed up,i want to adjust it in an angle to hear something.


sound quality is good good bass and audio but 'FOR ME' it started hurting and that loop is of no use also earcubs are cheap quality......fitting can be differnt for other people

I loved the packaging... Metal box with stickers inside... The feel of the earphones is amazing with flat cable... I am using the rubber earbuds of my previous earphones coz they fitted my ears better so scope of improvement in the quality of earbuds provided... Noise cancellation is pretty great but can definitely be better... Most definitely an upgrade for my boat earphones but realme earphones are better than ant studio.

I bought it for 470 from amazon its its worthy for money packing was pretty good . But this is waste earphones forever why because it's not hold in ears.

Sound quality is not good as sony or jbl. Overall i dont like to use this because of poor sound quality.

Well well well this brand ant audio firstly I was confused that this is UK brand what will be the after sales services and how the product will be but after purchasing the product it totally changed my perception. I have tried different brand like sound magic,boss,jbl. But this earphones sound quality above all bass and treble are just completely perfect. 

After one month the microphone is not working.

I love this product vey much don't know how it seduced me like anything it became my very closest friend of my alone times... the sound quality... wow.. its just mesmerisingly good
And the bass OMG i was shocked
But the sadest thing is from last 7days one of my earphone is not working it was like heartburn please do have an solution for my concern my honest review
PLEASE HELP ME WITH THIS

Mic is not good

The earphone wires make a sound
It was really disappointing for me

These earphones are just overrated. I got 3 of them for my self, brother and a relative. One of its mics stopped working. The other ones had issues like sound and socket fitting.

no bass its only for heard music sound but the sound is pain in ears build quality super .not worth for money

I bought the ant ear phone for 499. The holders given in the ear phone gets removed often.Without the rubber holder it doesn't stick to.your ears and falls down because of the heavy cable.
Sound quality and noise cancellation is pretty fine.

You can prefer Boat 155 instead.

Pros
-Super fast delivery by Amazon
-Perfect fit in the ears, doesnt fall off
-Pretty good packaging
-Sound Quality is decent
-Surprsingly, I liked the treble in this piece

Cons
-Distortion at higher volume
-Disappointed with the bass. I ordered this based on the reviews on bass but didn't find it impressive

The sound quality is not even close to what the default with phone ear phones offer. No doubt the looks of this product is 10/10 but the reality is sound quality is 2/10.

Also if you are trying to use this for taking calls, other party always complain of very low sound.

just 1 rash accidental moment with a wire and sound completely went off in one year plug

You can also get a pair of silicone earphone hooks from aliexpress for the same price itself, for added stability. I started to experience the true potential of this headphone only after using the foam earbuds. The VOLUME, BASS and NOISE CANCELLATION are awesome. The cable quality is also good. Blindly got for it. THIS CAN ALSO BE USED BY ANYONE WHO IS NEW TO EARBUDS JUST LIKE ME, PROVIDED YOU GET THE FOAM EARBUDS.

After 4 months this earphone is not working..But sound quality is okay.. quality should improve.

Don't buy this product this is so bad sound is hilarious

product failure in one month

Honestly I was a bit sceptical before buying this product... Read a few reviews and thought it's worth a shot for just 600 bucks... Firstly the beautiful metallic box looked so premium..Have used JBL Skullcandy Boat and other brands... This one beats them hands down... Amazing Bass quality... That too nice thumping one...

Within a year, it got damaged. But when I reached claim warranty they said it's been over a year since date of purchase.So remember date of purchase is the order date not the delivery date.


One end of the earphone stopped working after 5 months of usage. The quality of sound is good, noise cancellation doesn't always work.

he packaging is extremely good. I hope they had invested similar resourced to the product. Received a completely brand-new and premium-feel product in a day. Opened it, loved it at first glance.They supplied it in a decent box, with couple of music and brand stickers. A note was attached. Write a review, and send it to our social media handles to earn goodies.Coming to the product, one of the earphones was not working. Disappointed. I placed the return request.

Though bass is not that great as much as I would have loved but overall produces pretty nice over all sound. Very sturdy design.

Durability of the earphones is below average.
One side stopped working within 6 months

gives terrible headache..Makes you sensitive to any sound whatsoever..doest fit in ears, no matter what you do..one side stops working just after few days of use..

Best for gaming purpose because of low bass and good quality of sound, noise cancellation is pretty decent does it's job properly. Overall quality of the wire is good, but the ear bud rubber is kind of cheap quality. 4.5 out of 5

Guys this Ant earphone are awesome you should go and buy it. The quality ,purity,bass of the earphone are extremely excellent.

Amazon.Bass is loud and clear. Sound quality is not bad but the pain is intense for me.I would be more happy to use if the ear tips were comfortable.

The expectation is fulfilled

It's over hyped product noise cancellation is worst and sound clarity not good although bass is quite good

After two months of usage, got one side dead

Bass very low, vary thin sound

Left side volume is very low

Not happy at all...left side is not working.. not completed one month and it's now broken...very disappointed..

One side not working in few months

Left side stops not recommended at all

This earphones are good i used it before but and its durable too but when i odered this i got defective piece then i replaced it but again i got defective peace so first check the product properly

Produce Very high noise when connected to laptops.

They are awesome earphones but good quality and good bass. They were working fine till yesterday but today they are not working properly. Sometimes the voice is becoming too slow and sometimes it is too loud and I have adjust wire accordingly so get the noice.

If you are a bass lover,then this is where your search ends.

Average

Left speaker volume is very low. Not happy with the all the recent Ant products I bought.


Ears are getting hurt when lestining to it

These earphones have a particular sound signature and loudness to them that you will either dislike or simply fall in love with. Don't get me wrong about the bass. I mostly listen to rock so for rock you can really feel the drum "kick" with these earphones. The loudness is superb.

But I wouldn't call the soundstage of these all that great, since I have heard wider soundstage and am able to hear more instruments in earphones like leaf dash and leaf bolt at the same price point. Also the bass of Leaf Bolt is far superior than Ant audio.

Overall, for EDM and ground smacking bass, go for earphones like Leaf Bolt, Realme Buds 2 and Boat Bassheads 225.

But if you want something solid, and wanna hear that solid KICK of the drums in sings, you will find love for these earphones. I would say it's just something about the sound signature of these earphones that makes you really want to keep them. Comfort and fitting is also great on these, and they come inside a nice aluminium box, with optional stickers inside. That's something you do not get with any other earphone at this price range or even for many higher price range earphones as well.

I would say, if you have the money and are a music enthusiast, these are a must have for you. But if you are looking for an oveall best deal, then Leaf Bolt is the best option. Or if you are looking for earth shattering bass and decent quality, then go for Realme Buds 2.

But if you just want a solid deal and want that sweet aluminium box that comes with these earphones, and want the BEST LOUDNESS for the price range, then look no further, go for these!

Look the reason it cuts down the price from 500 and drops to the range of 300 is because they stopped giving the allumanium box as well as the stickers you preety much get the earphones and thats it sound quality is okk and overall its a good deal in this price range.

Voice is clear but noice cancellation is average.
Have some problem while adjusting it in my ear. But overall it's a good buy in this price rang

The Product i received it was I don't know it was used or what there was dust in the product
2)box was in horrible condition
3) earphone is good but not the price level
4) sound quality and noise cancellation is quit good but bass quality is so poor

Physical overview: Earphones are strong and long lasting.

"""""For calls: Mic is not that good you have to keep it near to your mouth in order to be audible to the other person(not suitable for making calls when your out, other wise acceptable)."""""----i too was not aware of this fact even reading so many reviews so don't skip it and have a look.

Sound quality: You will experience a nice hd sound quality . In full volumes also there are no vibrations in the earphones.Specially Good for English songs. It gives a balanced bass and treble. Very comfortable sound you can tolerate for longer periods.

Ear bud Quality: Ear buds are of very poor quality won't stay in the ears for longer you have to keep on tightening it. During sweat they will easily slip.

the earphone gives quite a good output but it's failed to deliver just within three months which is quite horrible and it is just a tedious process to get in touch with anyone at all for getting it fixed within warranty. I don't even know whom to approach. I filled in a form online and there has been no response since

I feel so bad and I can't wait to see quality of antaudio earphones but sadly one side is not working and product is seems to be badly used why people think they are going best in the market but this type of work is not appreciate your product and service are make me confused why people are give 4 and 5 star on Amazon and YouTube too watching this product on YouTube

Sound quality is fine, but its very brittle and cannot be usefull for a medium to rough use or prolonged usage no metallic box as displayed


Pro - Audio quality is really good.
Cons - wire and ear grip is cheap quality, keeps falling off. Overall gives cheap Chinese product feeling.

First I would say I am a fan of their product packaging.Truly impress.About Sound quality it is way better than JBL,Sony 1000 range earphones and are affordable.It is easily adjustable to any ears

Its good.. Value for the money

I bought this earphone on September 2019, totally satisfied with the earphone till April 2020 (During Lockdown).
Sound Quality, Build Quality is great. Totally satisfied with the bass- treble, noise cancellation.

On April 2020 one side of this earphone stopped working, as I had another Headphone so I started using that and Packed this earphone and I thought I'll claim warranty after lockdown ends. So In June I claimed RMA(Warranty) for the earphone, and it got accepted but unfortunately was unable to parcel the earphone to AcroRMA (Delhi) because of restrictions. So my warranty period got over in August 2020. And now I don't have any option to get my earphone fixed. 

Everything is amazing except that the pin is in L shape at the end and it causes certain problems like wire twisting when you keep it in pocket and the handles in earpiece is removable which sometimes get removed automatically (like when you take it out of pocket it won't be there) and I've lost one already. They should've given it attached to earpiece so that there won't be fearnof losing that handle. Except this everything is amazing

the earphone gives quite a good output but it's failed to deliver just within three months which is quite horrible and it is just a tedious process to get in touch with anyone at all for getting it fixed within warranty. 

The product I received was damaged,I.e. the right earpiece was not working.i am writing this review after listening to the left earpiece,the sound quality was good.

Material quality great. Sound is good but don't expect anything extraordinary. Bass is just about fine. I bought Boat 225 with this and they have a heavier bass. If you play games like PUBG then tracing footsteps in isolation of other sound will be difficult in this model as compared to Boat 225, where spotting enemy through footsteps is much easier and adds so much advantage in your game because of footsteps audio clarity and isolation due to heavier bass in Boat 225. Ant W56 rules in design, looks, decent sound quality.

Though bass is a little bit higher than usual, but it delivers good quality and clear sound output. Extreme bass lovers will be happy with this product. Voice clarity is very good but treble is little bit muffled as it is expected because of high bass. Overall very good quality of cable and earpiece, if used with care it can last really long time.

Don't buy is product this earphone did not have any microphone fake microphone. Good things:- ultimate bass.Bad things :- build quality is not that great and one site is note working after few days, treble are muddy.

Sounds are more than good but base is to high which is not good. You can't hear on full volume. Base will start hitting your ear and sound also won't be as clear as it should be. On medium volume it's amazing.

Sound, bass and noise cancellation all fine and ok and precisely more thn the price range. Worth buying

The product automatically increases or decreases volume and this thing is going on from around 1 month. First i felt, maybe my mobile is not updated and hence such issues are arising but no, it is product defect and it started exactly after 5-6 months of purchase. Product was okish but now.. i wont recommend this to someone else.


ok... ok

One side of earphones stopped working in less than 1 month

After 3 months it stopped working

I might give the bass quality 4.5/5 but it doesn't makes that much of a difference..So totally satisfied with the product + how can you forget about the case. It's so sexy and classy!! I more liked it because of the case

Nice

Design: 2/5 (Flat, light wires almost as bad as the Syska H-007 earphones. Curved design of the earphones is the only saving grace!)

But after 2 months again mic, controller and connecter failed. The propable cause for the failure of mic might be due to sweat, as I sweat a lot. But they claim it is sweat proof. 

Decent sound. Quality is also good. But I don't like the return policy and process of ant audio.

bought it on hearing about the reviews... sound quality was pretty good tho but even if the parts are made of metals.... i think i had a loose connection developed in mine (wires) resulting in no audio in one of the bud.... lasted for roughly 2 months.... not for rough use.....

Do not buy these earphones. They stopped working after 2 months. The bass was good and sound was crisp and clear but after 2 months they gave up on me suddenly when I was watching YouTube videos. My advice would be to not to buy these and save your money.

Packaging box was sealed with transparent plastic which contain steel box and then the earphone with accessories inside it, I liked the quality packing.
I choose Ant audio because of flat wire able quality is really good also liked the mic button it's not appear to be a button again the quality is good.
The durability of L shape pin is higher than straight pin in personal experience (personal views).
The only disadvantage I find here, is the ear hook. Because the ear plugs don't fit without this hooks.

Earphone sound quality was great but its built quality is very bad.. using it for 3 months and today its left speaker stopped working . There is an issue with wiring near the jack. Please improve it Ant Audio. Everyone is complaining about the built quality and you are doing nothing.

If we are spending our valuable moneny than of cource we need genuine item also. For few discount amount , we are getting cheat by seller. I humbly humbly request you to PLEASE PLEASE buy from antaudio original website. You will get great product from original site for your

If You are looking For Good sounding Earphone Than Here it is . I was Impressed with design & sound. But There is One issue with mic its Not Sustainable more than 20-25 Day later . if U are Not Using For Calling purpose than Its Fine. Yes in Market There are some Big Brands Also Not provides Mic like Sennheiser . But peoples are Buying It just For Sound Quality . & One More thing Its Comes with Metallic Box Which very good to carry anywhere

average sound quality even honor am115 is lot better than this..at this price range either go for jbl,boat or Sennheiser..warranty is lie...if your headphone not working...all you have to do is courier the product to them with your expense...then they replace the product...I don't understand why I have to pay courier charges for faulty pieces...

Great bass and loud sound which ultimately gives you pain in your ears. After listening to such a loud sound my ear was ringing and paining too. I returned the product back to Amazon.

Earphones are good no doubt...But after sale service is worst. I ordered this earphones and after few months one earbud was not working. I sent earphones to Acro via courier. Then after few days they sent same product. They didn't repair anything to earphones. Worst service provided by Acro engineering company. Better to go with Boat.

I like the head set and the bass is excellent but if you are speaking someone through the head set they hearing some disturbance noices...i order this headset twice..but each head set life is less than a year...

Overall a balanced earphone. Sound is OK. Bass and treble are clear. Do not expect very high quality as in sennheiser. But good for price. Wires are flat and do not mixup. Call quality over mic is good. Used it once rain. Was OK. Miss the magnetic back.

From the experience i have had.. Sound quality is good. Ok bass. Comfort not so good. Compatability with mobile is worst. Hope they improve their quality.

Bass is ok.
Noise cancellation is also ok.
All over quality is very poor.

Ant Audio is new company in the market So many people will take review of this product whether to purchase it or not but as I have purchased their earphones and the product is really really good. Audio quality is Awesome bass is amazing earphones look Stylish and is made up of good material so no worry of damaging of this product and their packaging is very amazing in the package you will get a metal box and inside it you will get stickers user guide and earphones with two ear tips So don't think too much about it and go for the product

Medium bass. Fully faulty product

Worst product ever. After 2nd of month .jack problem accur and after 2-3 days they stop working. I claim for compny .they just gave me first email reply after no responce from ent audio .. and if you go for bass headphone then dont buy . Bass is not as much as they said

What I heard about it, was true, what a bass quality,... Fantastic, awesome, crazy bass, I loved it....tested with NCS bass music, 8D songs, 4D songs, it is perfect for your ears just at Ra 476.... What can be better than that...

I've been using Ant Audio w56 for a long time. Recommended.
Wish other than black comes with the Metal Box packaging.
Comfortable to wear for a long time. Great fit. Audio is great compared to other products in this price group.
Quality Product.

This earphones actually worth every rupees... The bass and sound.. It feels like you are in theater... In short produces high quality sound... But it lasted for 7 months for me... And i bought same earphones again..AA W56 will be my 2nd earphone again..

This earphone is amazing. The extra bass is the beast. The packaging was quite nice. Though the box had a little scratch on it i am Positive that it was unused. I got this for 599 and i am very happy and satisfied. The pouch is handy and i liked it. The wire quality is pretty good. The two Negatives which are not that important and can be ignored were that the ear hooks are not that great. It doesn't fits in the ear properly and there is only one button for all the function.

Overall amazing earphones and i am satisfied. :)

For rs450 it's good,dont go for it when it's above rs500 as infinity zip100 is there at 550.
Bass quality is really good
Vocals are also adequately clear
Treble part is not good and instrumental separation is average

Some r saying it has harsh treble part, that's a complete misjudge,treble is not good where is harsh sound

Fieldspace(how wide your sound stage)is narrow(though it can handle pubg movements)

Build quality is excellent

Mic is descent

Edm,Bollywood upbeat songs are good to listen in it(songs with more instrumentals are not preferable in this)

Now i dont know its longivity,will post it later

Which set i bought in 2018 was totally classy royal premium with metal box and stickers and NOW we can't even hear bass too much, before it was GREAT and now HATE

About the sound, it has the best noise cancellation I've seen so far, the punching bass and surrounding bass both are perfectly balanced to give you that theatrical effect. Highs and mids are also balanced, but trebles are slightly low. If you like more trebles, buy sennheisers. (Really, you don't like bass?). Overall this is the worth buying under 1000rs. And you'll get a small surprise gesture once you unbox. Thank me later!

The Bass Of These Earphones Is Very Deep. The High's Is Also Good. I'm a Bass Head And I Am Surprised With The Bass On These Earphones. The Bass On This Earphones Is Equal To My Headphones. There Aren't Any Con's For This Earphones. Also Ear Tips OF Different Sizes Are Provided. There Are Also Stickers Provided. A Very Good Metal Box 

The product was good in sound and built, still one side of the earphone stopped working. By the looks and build quality, I didn't expect it to be like this. Tried claiming warranty, but got nothing, like no way to even contact or claim

It does'nt have way too much bass, which I personally prefer. The sound is quite clear for this reason, which makes it suitable for games in which you should listen to the faintest sounds and for watching videos where its hard to understand what they say. The flat wires are nice as they tangle less and I prefer handling ribbon wires instead of the traditional ones. The right angled jack is usefull since I can't grip my phone properly with normal jacks, when I play games with 4 fingers. On the right side wire, the inner wiring started poping out the insulation slightly, very early on and it kept poping out more over time but it did'nt cause any problem. After 5 months of use, the right side stopped working randomly, so its like paying 100 rs a month to use these earphones. It sounds very identical to ant audio wave 702 but it looks cooler, has a better packaging, clip and rubber attachements which are quite useless and an unnecesary complication. So, its better to throw away the rubber attachments. If you can get both for the same price, go for w56 as it looks cool and comes with a clip. Despite its drawbacks, I will still buy another one as I think its better than the other earphones in the market.

Cons----many.....hissing sound on the wire while on call... Ear hooks durability is max 3..4 mnths...


To Keep The Earphones Is Also There. There Is No Distortion Even When There Is Very Deep Bass Songs Are Played. You Won't Ever Regret Buying These Earphones! Just Go For It If You Are Planning To!! Thanks Ant Audio For The Superior Sound And Built Quality!

Believe me, there is absolutely no bass in this. The Treble is very high, mids are average and bass is very low. Most of the time, the instruments overpower the vocals coz of high treble. The earphones which came free with Transcend mp3 player gives better sound quality than this. Apart from bass, the music listening experience itself is pathetic. Ths sound is very thin.

8 months ago I used realme buds 2 it is good earphone overall but yesterday the ant audio had delivered and believe me guys this one is better than realme buds 2.. I just loved them This earphone is best in this price and sound & bass are superb

I brought this after reading so many reviews. (Wanted to try a new brand of audio, before i used Harman JBL) Before even testing sound quality, the earphones didn't fit perfectly for my mobile (HONOR PLAY). I DONT THINK THAT IT IS EXACT 3.5MM. So had to return it the next day

It is an awesome earphone in this price range.... If you have used boat earphone....i would say it's somewhat similar. The bass is damn good. And I have used senheiser earphone earlier..... I will say this earphone has better bass than senheiser..... If you love bass I will recommend you to go for it. I know you will be more confused looking at the reviews and all and would probably think should I buy it or not...... I was confused too. I decided to buy it. Received it with a nice package and the bass I really love.

I bought this earphone by friend suggest. I am using this earphone and have not faced any problems yet. Mostly I used headphone during traveling for listening music and watching videos. After using for nearly two months , I am writing this review.

Speak of a earphone that comes like a gift, damn. These pair of earphones comes with the most premium packaging. Never seen anything like this. The music quality, top notch. As I've seen most of the reviewers say it's better than the boat 225, I'd like to say it's not really better or worse. If anything, the any beats the boat by a 0.5% margin.

Had bought this because mic was not working on previous headphones. But mic stopped working within 1 month. Had brought the same earphones few years back which i used for 2 years without any issue. Looks like the product quality is not as good as before.

Top quality build. The music performance is really really impressive. It's what you'd expect of a earphone you'd pay 3-4 grand for. The bass is simply insane. You won't find the need to install additional equalisers or anything of that sort. The treble is pretty good too, nothing to complain about.

Below avergae. Product was unsealed and damaged. No warranty card inside

Exactly After 1 year ,1 month and 4 days. Writing this review i purchased it for ₹ 525(applying promo + sale offer). I used it for gaming, pretty much everyday. Never feel like it is an 1 year old earphone. I was using it roughly by thinking that it's still under warranty 😂. Btw it's now selling for 399 just go 4 it. Will never disappoint.

If there's one thing I would like you guys to improve, it's the delivery of music at low volumes. I feel the volume needs to increased to a 65+ to feel the real output of the music.

The five star is mainly for the fittings in the ear I haven't seen anything like this which fits so comfortable and so tightly in the ear bass and Beats and low all are very excellent at this price. I got this at a deal of around 550rs . It comes with nice metallic box which can be used for some other purposes along with the few types of ear tips .don't expect anything much at this price. 

Ultimate experience I would suggest to go for headphones it has a mic also it has thick cable Packaging of the box is very good the earphone feels solid.my recommendation will be to save money at least for a year then wait for a billion sale or Amazon sale and purchase a very good pair of headphones ultimately that will satisfy your name all the ear phones in the range of nearly around 2000 rupees are same it's better to save money and go for headphones

First Of All.. Thanks Amazon For The Unexpected Fast Delivery, I Received The Earphones Within 24 Hours. Got It In 17-18 Hours. Then About The Earphones, The Price Coated On the Box Is Rs.1,299 But Got It For A Price Rs.499. Theses Earphones Are Worth Their Price. They Don't Lack In Sound Quality And Built Quality.

Sound quality bahut jada bekar hai or build quality us se bhi bekar hai . Dont buy


Not able to claim warranty most the time their service center in kochi was down due to Pandemic out burst


Even at the first glance it already had a nice impression on me because of the build design, although i was a bit skeptical at first since it was a newly launched product. And the sounds are great. The build quality could've been better since the earpice around the edges were quite sharp..but not that big an issue. Images attached.  Could've included a dedicated volume + or volume -

Packing was is worst and I didn't get earphones in steel box ..and warranty card.I think that this are not orginal product from ant. I want to return it.

it's excellent,noise cancellation is very good if you listen to music above 50 - volume, you can't hear anything,earphones have a gold plated 3.5mm Jack,but after a month it becomes silver color,best recommended for gaming and music.

Worst earphone ever, don't waste your money. At first they didn't even worked, after a few try they worked and even then only one earplug was working and that too was so low in volume that I could hard listen to the music even on full volume

They are almost sound similar to the Mi ones that I use. After some testing, I felt the Mi ones played the soft bass (the super lows ~50 Hz) slightly better. But the packaging is something unique with a metal box and some surprises inside, giving a sweet unboxing experience 

 really very bad earphone this bass is not good correct stereo sound

Recently lost my loyal Sennheiser CX275 headphones to old age, may she (yes 'she') rest in peace. When looking for a temporary alternative until I decide on a good wireless ear bud, I stumbled upon these beauties. Now I have been using Ant's mechanical keyboard for a while and am delighted with the quality. Hoping that they deliver the same quality across the board, bought this pair to check (honestly was expecting to return them due to bad quality). But man have they delivered yet again, these are so good that the only minute difference I can pick out from my old Sennheiser is the cripsness of the sound is a little less in these guys, but totally a bang for you buck at nearly 1/3rd the price of the former.

Heres my opinion,
Pros:
-Very cheap considering the sound quality
-Comes in an awesome metal tin with classy packaging and some funky stickers (always a sucker for stickers)
-So far is compatible with every phone and 3.5mm jack I plugged this into.
Cons:
-Build quality feels cheap, hopefully will last me long
-Mic quality could be a little better but unless you're using it to record HD sound tracks, you shouldn't be worried

I received product with loose wiring in mic. So some time it works good and some time it works like hell. I have also buy this product from antaudio genuine site. Both packing are different and also mainly QUALITY

No review here has said about how uncomfortable these earphones are. It fell of the ear if support is not used. If it is used, you cant wear it for long. It is helpful though, cuz it saves your time, ..how?? Cuz u won't be listening to music long by using this earphone. I like it.

I have ordered 7 units of ant sudio uptil now. My recent purchase was a piculiar incident. Whether it is quality issues or the muddy lows with sharp pitch. Literally my hearing was affected. So i decided to spend 100 more... Go to flipkart and brought the new earphone. M so happy...


I have purchased it in January and they have started having problems after sometime and now they have completely stopped.

Guy trust me, i have used samsung, candy crush, jbl and boat. All of them are good in their own way, but i loved Ant Audio w56. It got the base and well balanced sound that i expected from every other earphones i used.

Worst product you can purchase at this amount...when I first ordered that product I found issues while making calls and when I reordered that product again. It was worse than earlier the Jack is not supported and after 15 listening to music or making calls it got disconnected again.

Just received the package from amazon. I was expecting the metal box and the stickers as they were a part of the product but to my surprise, they sent the cheap plastic base(as shown in the image), and yeah no stickers. I mean half of the products were sold with the box and stickers but what about the other half? (Do you think we are here to gamble?). 

#noMetalBox, yes, please don't expect any metal box , they've stopped giving it.Excellent build quality and sound quality. Premium feel and look

Got to know about this brand in YouTube. Must say better than Boat225!

Sounds Quality and build Quality is good ..but you gonna be very disappointed to know that Ant audio jas changed its packaging that i was looking for years and now i had bought and I'm upset very regretful that its packaging had changed (before packaging was including one metal box with ant audio stickers but now one plastic panel to hold earphone that's it)
Ant audio had the best packaging but now he lost respect and Goodwill from my side 

Good

Everything is fine about the product but its bass is not too good. It is not the best deal to have this product at this price its just ok. I will suggest to go for boat bassheads or JBL at this range.

Before reading my review please understand that my review is directed only to warn people who care about "clarity" as opposed to the people who like muddy and pounding low-end ("extra bass") right inside their ears.

After 3 months of using the rightside of the earphones stopped working. Just for returning it 😒 ...which I could have purchase other earphones for the same price.

This product is good
I have been using till today. But no issues found with this product

Product is good but I not received box and sticker in that product tbh the product Is awesome but amazon not gaved box 

on receiving the earphones, not only there was no metal box, however, there were no extra earbuds. The item was packed like one of those roadside/one-time usable earphones.

I got clone of W56, so I replaced it, after few days again I got another defected earphone... Even after replacement you are not providing genuine products... Don't fool people, we are not fools, we know the right quality of Ant Audio..... I am using it from years...... Get it..."STOP SELLING FAKE ITEMS".

Not so good but OK.

Good ..

Sound quality is acceptional

One fact that can totally make you understand about how this earphone is...if you are planning to buy boat 225 then go for this one instead. The bass quality is same and this one's sensitivity is way too better than boat one. This one is lighter than the boat one and the slipping of earheads from ear problem is no longer a problem with this one even though this one is still a metal head.My previous earphone was boat 220 which is the kinda ancestor of boat 225 as they discontinued the 220 one after launching the new model 225 

There is no Metal box and stickers inside the packet of those who bought it for 349 /-. I have read many reviews, everyone has said that and I have not got it either. That's why they are selling it cheaper.
But if you leave that thing aside, this earphone is excellent in the case of audio, voice clearity, bass, treble, mic.
The only problem is the wire which I think is a bit thin. They should have to give little thicker wire.

At this price point it is a gud deal..it gives excellent overall sound...it produces a flat sound nto too bass not too treble..and block almost all the outside noices...you can definitely enjoying listening to music with this earphones...and the built quality is good and chord has also good quality..and tangle free also..

sound quality is good but build quality is cheaper then older one. older have a much better build quality . but anyways sound quality is equal and good .

An awesome product from Ant Audio Indeed. The packaging is premium you get your earphones in a pristine metal box, with lovely stickers, a welcome card and three sizes of ear buds. The earphones as a whole sound surreal. The sound quality is perfect the vocals are highlighted and the noise cancellation works like a charm. I would like to add that the noise cancellation is not the best in the market but hey the overall experience is unbeatable in the given price range. It's a definite just buy the damn thing from me.

Product quality does not meet as expected.Inner tin box is missing.low sound.Product package is completely different as shown in product catalogue and customer reviews.

In my first impression, sound quality is excellent, deep bass is superb, delivered much more of expectations, just hoping to last till a year, fingers crossed . Will update after few months about the durability, but seems quite rugged . Great pair of headsets , better than Boat Bassheads 225 my last earphone .

I love this. One of my fav. Bcoz under 1,000 This is the best For Bass lover , I mean for me.;) Yes highs are not clear. I mean its soo clear but highs are coming with some punchy and deep high. Sooo i heard some High tune with bass.

I ordered green/neon colour but got orange instead. I don't mind that bcuz the quality of the sound as per the price is really good.

I have been using this earphones for the past two years now and it never disappointed me and I'm still using it. While playing FPS games like PUBGM and CODM the foot steps are so clear and when it comes to music you can easily differentiate between the mids and highs. I can't believe for a price of 470 ant audio is providing such an amazing audio devices.

Best budget headphones bought got it delivered on 25 January, 2020. Now using them for more than 6 months now still doing great.

My sister accidentally left these earphones in her pocket and forgot to remove them before putting her clothes into the washing machine. These earphones however survived it! It was completely intact, no issues at all. Truly waterproof earphones. The sound quality, noise cancellation and bass quality are all good. It's comfortable to wear and I would recommend it to anyone who's looking to buy new earphones .

At the Price range of 499 these are the 2nd best earphones (Boat Baseheads 225 is first). I am not music lover type of person but while listening some random music what I noticed that I can clearly hear all the instruments in background, So that's the plus point but why this is on 2? Because in terms of bass production it produces soft base, like very low base but still you can feel it, while in BH225 Bass is great. 

Bass heads just go for it ! This one is a beast. Don't look at the Negative comments like "One side stopped working within 1 week" and so on... It happens with few ones of every brand and products. Even my sennheiser stopped working.

This is one of the best mid range headphones it bought till date. Bass is awesome, noise cancellation is good compared to the price point. Good for listening Rock, Hiphop and pop genres. Don't buy this if you are a classical /country lover.There is a metal box provided with this box, 4 different pieces of ear buds.The most useable things in this headphone is built in mic.Wire is tangle free, so no need to worry about.

I've used CX 180,JBL C150si, Ptron boom 2,boat bashead 225...and last this one. I'm now regretting for all of the previously bought ones (except cx 180, but its bass is low). I've used CX 180,JBL C150si, Ptron boom 2,boat bashead 225...and last this one. I'm now regretting for all of the previously bought ones (except cx 180, but its bass is low).

This one is a beast. Don't look at the Negative comments like "One side stopped working within 1 week" and so on... It happens with few ones of every brand and products. Even my sennheiser stopped working within 1 month and then I bought another same one and its still with me now. You will never regret for buying this one.

When i buying this at a rate of 399 there is no metal box and stickers,,,
So be alert when buying at offer prices,,,
The sound quality and bass quality are awesome 

Great earphones, the build is strong, the sound quality is decent and the design is great. Heavy on the bass. The flat wire is an advantage as it doesn't tangle up much. Mic works fine. Unfortunately, it only lasted about 10 months for me until one side of the earphones stopped working. I'm an everyday user and even dropped these earphones quite often. It will be great for a normal usage.

Would not recommend to go for these earphones. Quality of the sound is not good for when used vivo smartphone. there are no stickers in thr packaging box and also the tin box is missing, BOAT would have a better choice..i repeat, purchase these at your own risk

Definitely for bass lovers, bass is lit  Overall a good product. Highlight :- bass, good build quality, tangle free flat cable, packaging is the best part, l shape connector is quite useful it's look weird at first sight but when i using it, i found that it's a useful thing.

The earphone is excellent quality. This earphones are especially for bass lovers in a low budget. The wire is also intangible. There's only 1 problem that the earpiece use to slip out of the ear due to its weight but for this they have given you silicon support and a clip .

Good

Not working after one year of use . Working good for one year .

Great choice for 500. I got these after trying a bunch of sub 1000 earphones. For the price paid these are completely worth the money. I got them for 480. These are waay better than most of the headphones you find in this range.

I used many brands but this one is so so trustable and provide good customer support. And sound quality including bass is just amazing

This earphone is great in this price range, great sound quality, nice bass and excellent noise cancellation but build quality is poor. You will have to handle it with delicate care if you want it to last long. Not for continuous travelling or rough use. You can use it at home. I would suggest you to buy it only if you normally stay at home and don't travel too much.

Heard about this Ant Audio Headset from a sound engineer who really recommended this. Bought the product and to be honest, I am really happy with what I got. The sound quality is just phenomenal. The Bass, the treble and the depth of the music is clearly audible and differenciable. Be it any acoustic song or any EDM you would love to hear, simply pick the headset and enjoy the stream of good music. Must buy recommendation. You'll be happy with the quality of the product.

They are muddy, lack clarity and have too much bass (even the low end is muddy) to them.


Now this is one of the best headphone i have ever bought...have used many other branded ,sony ,jbl and skul candy. They all wer gud at there price range above 2k. But believ me this ant w56 i have ordered last night at 10pm and i have reciced the same next day by 9am..lightening fast delivery...thanks to amazon

Material quality- the quality is premium no doubt but a little disappointment is the rubber plug for ear which is loose and comes off easily. Sound quality- its a real stereo earphone. The good thing is also that the bass is increased with perfect match with stereo. Hence for those who wants earphone for both gaming and listening to music, this will fit the role because purely 

Not too bad for this price.Go for it if it's under 500rs

I get it offer price 399. This earphone is good on this price . But company didn't send me the metal box and user manual.

Forget JBL, Boat or Skullcandy. This Ant headphones are next level and peerless. At this price they offer more, you can blindly go for it. Starting from the package this headphones provides best sound experience. Am not exaggerating here, believe me i tried 500-1000rs worth headsets like JBL, Boat and Skullcandy.

All these products are good and has worthy sound experience but somewhat am not quite satisfied because of the flat boom sound(some can understand this point). Eventhough JBL, Boat and Skullcandy provide good sound & base i feel like something still missing.

I'm totally in love with it...I still don't know how it is in the long run as I just bought it and it is my first time trying anything from ant audio…I think it's a wonderful earphone for its price...EDM and similar categories (like me), this earphone is perfect....It also has Good quality flat wire which is durable and definitely doesn't feel cheap...

Every thing is nice in this product, the box is really good and strong even I am using this(box) perfectly after 1.5 months though the earphones are not working now and I am now shifted to realme buds 2. The earphones worked very well for 5 months but afterwards left earpiece stopped working and after 4 more months the right one also did the same thing and then it was of no use and complete waste for me. But it was worth buying because of that good quality box with it.

The package is just a blast. You get a bundle of things within. A tin case containing earphones, some stickers, a carrying case(which I did'nt got).
Coming to the built quality, the earbuds are made of metal and the aesthetics are good. The cable is flat making it tangle free for most of the time and is of good quality.
The sound is pretty much good but the bass is decent. Lows and mids are clear no doubt. But if you are a bass lover go for cx180 or JBL series or boat 225.
Customized setting on music players might give you better results.
Outside noise cancelling is achieved only when the volume is near 70%.
Overall they are worth the penny.
Even more you will like those fancy stickers they offer

HEADPHONE IS ABSOLUTELY FINE ITS MORE THAN MY EXPECTATION but pls be careful the headphone will not work well on any desktop or computer because when you will plug in the jack it will be ok but after 2 months it will give a little electrical shock so these headphones are only good for mobile users, not pc users

According to me ant is just amazing at the price tag of 499 better than boat 225 because the boat earphone are not much comfortable and the left earpiece comes out of the ear again n again. This is just amazing earphone

Review after 1 week -- sound quality is good ,base is nice best budget earphones go for it.
After 2 Months:
Listen guyz actually they provide nice box and stickers so we thought they provide lots of things and also base is good but only for 1 month after that its even not working properly.
After One Month Its sounds quality will be distorted.Bass is very terrible seriously.
I know everyone watched reviews of the product on YouTube like me and will going to buy but seriously don't buy it. I have personal experience now.
I don't recommend this product .
Hope you find this helpful

First of all the brand new packaging gave me awesome and heart satisfied feel. Totally cool product.. then the earphones, seriously the earphones are damn cool in look and feel too.. the housing of the earphones are made of metal. Also the 9mm driver inside provides cool sound in music. Well tangle free cable provided. 

ood product . Wire quality is very good and bass are amazing ...

I could say they are rocking it. Everything is perfect in this budget earphones. If some of the people are bass lovers then they should need to use equalizer setting based music apps. But i could say without any equalizer setting this earphones doing their job greatfully in providing bass, highs mids and lows.... In my opinion this product is worthy one.. just go for it.

The quality of the sound is very good which is unexpected... I suggest everyone can buy this product.

I love it and to mention I have already using this more than a year and I will recommend this to everyone itsl is worth for your money. Sound quality is the best level even compare to jbl cs100i and boat 225. Bass is supperrb

Bulit quality is best for the price (I'm a rough user ) it lasting more than a year. Packaging is the which where I fell live to ant audio they don't compromise in bulit quality, package and sound quality

Decent

Love the clear sounds, I like every little sounds you hear on this earphones and highs too!

Though bass is a little bit higher than usual, but it delivers good quality and clear sound output. Extreme bass lovers will be happy with this product. Voice clarity is very good but treble is little bit muffled as it is expected because of high bass. Overall very good quality of cable and earpiece, if used with care it can last really long time.

So this earphone is totally worth buying you don't have to think much longer other then which color which you want. Sound quality 10/10. Bass 9/10 ( depends on the volume of song, and song of course). Noise canceling 9/10

Srsly these are So good and thanks to amazon to deliver this just after 12 hours of order and amazing packaging and also really appreciated the accessories I got with the earphones in the box stickers, extra set of earbuds, warranty card, and etc. Box was also a solid metal which is good and then the build if earphones are just soo good feels like a solid product and sound quality is already perfect, guys buy it its completely worth it.

Good build quality. Treble is on the higher side however for the cost overall good

I bought this(green colour) in nov 2020(delivered on 6th nov)..
Earphones are value for money.

My review on build and sound quality :-
1. Build quality - I liked it, easy to put in and wire seems to be tangle free. If you are on bed in sleeping position, just be a little careful while turning your side as buds are medium in size not as small as senhizer cx 180 but still comfortable if not used harshly.
Appropriate for the price.
Wire - 9/10
Ear fitting - 8/10

2. Sound quality - One will experience awesome sound if the device supports dloby atmos as bass is finely tuned. So this earphone is one of the best with dolby atmos, all you need is a basic google music player and dolby atmos as equaliser, cheers!!
Bass - 9/10
Noise cancellation - 8/10
Sound quality - 8.5/10

Overall this product is value for money and it's comes 2nd in my list after senhizer cx180 if the budget is below 800rs.

It doesn't pop out of the ear. So that's definitely a step up. The wire is sturdy and the flat cable helps with zero detangling. The headset also comes with a nice tin box that you can use for other things after. Which is a nice feature to be honest.

I didn't got metal box, stickers and extra buds as shown in reviews. In images it was shown that others got earphones with a proper metal box, stickers and extra buds.But I only got earphones with a warranty card in a crushed cardboard box without metal box, stickers, and extra buds.

One other thing, The tin box was sealed. In Boat, because it comes in a cardboard box, sometimes you don't know if the stuff inside has been used previously or not. I know it is sealed, but the seal in Boat looks like it can be tampered with. Not so with Ant. Essentially, if you want to gift a guy a pair of headphones, this would be the best idea.

After much confusion, bought it on 23 march... and it turned out to be a beast considering sound quality, build quality and bass. got it for 499 and worth every penny. it was best in this segment simply go for it.. better than boat

Used very roughly for 1 year and left side was damaged due to my mishandling, so i claimed warranty before expiry of warranty period... And boom they have sent a brand new earphones of same kind and i got the same music quality like the previous one but the new earphones were a bit lighter compared to former.

One side of earphone is not working after few months and after that microphone not working


Hmmm finally my hunt for a great pair of earphones ends here...i love bass, that's what i feel a major need in any earphones or speakers, makes any song lively and punchy...i tried so many earphones.. starting with senhiesers cx180, then sound magic es18, sony mdr xb 50, audio technical, skull candy smoking smoking buds 2 bt wireless..and others panasonic , bluedio..and few others..i can say right now.. all of this suck in front of this earphones..i blindly bought it...seriously this are the best i heard so far...

HEADPHONE IS ABSOLUTELY FINE ITS MORE THAN MY EXPECTATION but pls be careful the headphone will not work well on any desktop or computer because when you will plug in the jack it will be ok but after 2 months it will give a little electrical shock so these headphones are only good for mobile users, not pc users

the best and unique feature of this earphones..is it has the best bass without compromising clarity...i found that in high end earphones like bose or rha...just go with it if you are bass lover like me..i wish the brand makes best earphones like this more...i guess only this model got good reviews..

Awesome sound quality and explosive bass.

I've been using Ant Audio w56 for a long time. Recommended.
Wish other than black comes with the Metal Box packaging.
Comfortable to wear for a long time. Great fit. Audio is great compared to other products in this price group.
Quality Product.

This earphone is hardly of 200rs..they say that this is stereo earphones, well f***ing mono earphones sound better than this.. 

I don't like it's packaging...it is without tin box . And blue colour is not good . It's different from the image shown.

Tin box was not given with the pack😌

It is a good product with nice sound quality and noise cancellation and good bass
But the thing is the wire is totally tangled at the time of delivery and I feel a bit delicate which can be torn off
Finally worthy product

Durability is not up to the mark. Worst product. Pathetic quality

The in-ear cups of this earphones have the flexible structure and are equipped with high-quality sound delivering technology
Philips SHE5305 is much much better option than this,,,.....

Worst when it comes to design, you cant wear this for more than 1 hour it hurts ear so bad, 9mm drivers whereas competitors offer 10mm at half this price. 

I like sound quality because i like bass quality,clear vocals & i also like built quality. It is value for money product, i suggests to purchase to people who serch best earphone under budget.

Bought 2 earphone and one earpiece stop working after 2-3 month on both my earphone..... it's hard to claim warrenty.... never gonna buy this product ever though bass in this earphone was great but what's the use of earphone when it will stop working in 2-3 months

I didn't try the earphones immediately, but the actual ear pieces (that plug into the ear) keep coming out of the holders. You pack the earphones in your bag and when you remove them, either one or both of the ear pieces is missing.

Better than boat, and any other brand, awesome bass, noise cancellation and sound quality. You will get a good experience. Value for money Boult products

The headphones are what they say. Although it is not supposed to sound like a "triple driver" headphones which cost 20 times more than this, it actually does a decent job. For the price, it is an excellent buy, just go for it if you like to use headphones without blowing up your ears and still want nice noise isolation.

I have IEM from Ultimate Ears, Shure & Bose. I have been trying headphones for casual use which doesn't need music involvement and was disappointed with Mi basics which would never keep inside the ears. With its wingtips, the ANT does an excellent job and the isolation is nearly perfect (I need to test it in a noisy situation). However, I would advise not to use them in public places as your awareness of your surroundings could be impacted because of this.

Must note : Try to use them with flat EQ or bit of treble boost, the bass is so strong, to feel the tightness you may want to avoid using EQ to avoid overshadowing the middle & upper range.

Update: I lost one of the ear wings after it slipped out of one of the speakers and there is no way to keep the earphone stable. Ant needs to provide basic replacement of this as an accessory for such a robust earphone.

I gave overall rating 4 because they have mentioned that we will receive the earphones in metal box but I received in a damaged paper box!!! Earphones is actually really good... It's worth one I have been using it for almost 1month and there is no issue

Left earphone stopped working only in 25 days. I dont know what happened ,but audio quality was superb and enough for pubg.

Noise cancellation is so much that every time when you talk to someone through earphones you have to hold thee mic close to your mouth , otherwise others can't hear you on phone.

Bought for 499.dislike for low quality cloth mesh n stopped working in a month. Filed for replacement where I had to pay for delivery to Delhi and it stopped working second time within a month audio only coming from one side and wire is unstable moving it will alter the sound, Poor design and Quality Disappointed.

(Bought on 6 Jan 2019) I enjoyed using these earphones and I don't use my earphones only for music. I also watch movies/YouTube/podcasts also so I dont like super boomy base which compromises mids and lows. These earphones were balanced with good amount of base. Build quality is good and these are amongst very few earphones that lasted more than a year with me (started making echoey noise on 16 Jan 2020.)

It's was not like I expected it to be.

Metal box not came with it

The highs,mids,vocals, are so cleared.
Worth the price,
But I am disappointed because they had not given me the tin ka dabba
Otherwise earphones are lit
Go for it.

Nice sound , and good bass , but they changed the package .

The product quality is utterly disappointing. Does not connect comfortably with either phone/laptop. The sound quality is terrible. The microphone is also terribly bad. I had the first product replaced, yet the replacement was bad. The delivery part was good though. Overall, recommend anyone not to purchase this product.

This is very nice earphone. This earphone music is very nice.

Good Product

Recieved today, the sound quality is good but it came with a small box and no stickers, and not that tin box.

Packaging has changed just a small pacjet no metal box or stickers ☹️ but product is ok if u get in somewhat under 500

Product is decent, but I also bought it for tin box n stickers which used to come along with it. Offlate they r sending it in normal paper box which spoiled half the fun!

I'd recommend buying any other earphone in this price range but this one. This earphone is very unsatisfactory. Fit is the worst. sound quality is okay. Not worth it imo.

Wire quality not good

Worst earphones I have ever bought. It is very weak and one part of the earphones broke very easily inspite of using and handling it carefully and the other part stopped working. It is a cheap quality product. I have wasted my money

First i got a damaged earphone after replacement i got new one that was owssm

I bought this earphone on September 2019, totally satisfied with the earphone till April 2020 (During Lockdown).Sound Quality, Build Quality is great. Totally satisfied with the bass- treble, noise cancellation.On April 2020 one side of this earphone stopped working, as I had another Headphone so I started using that and Packed this earphone and I thought I'll claim warranty after lockdown ends. So In June I claimed RMA(Warranty) for the earphone, and it got accepted but unfortunately was unable to parcel the earphone to AcroRMA (Delhi) because of restrictions. So my warranty period got over in August 2020. And now I don't have any option to get my earphone fixed. 

The sound quality is superb

Great sound quality

Average headphone

I used this earphone from 9 months and after that it's mike stop working but I claimed warranty and got again a new one so their customer support is awesome and earphones are also. I used this earphone from 9 months and after that it's mike stop working but I claimed warranty and got again a new one so their customer support is awesome and earphones are also
I used many brands but this one is so so trustable and provide good customer support
And sound quality including bass is just amazing

Does the job. Value for money. Noise cancelling is okay.

Worth to buy, you can go with this product

One side of my earphone stopped working properly like in 5 days of buying it after 2 days it totally stopped . The sound quality and the bass was good .


First of all hands down for the best earphones at the price of 400Rs, which I luckily got.
No complaints from earphones.
But the packaging was not as promised.
I did not receive any sticker neither the case. Little disappointed about that.

All things are great... specially when it comes to build quality ....sound quality is also good....but the comfort is slightly down....you can't wear it for above 3 hrs ..

Sounds Quality and build Quality is good ..but you gonna be very disappointed to know that Ant audio jas changed its packaging that i was looking for years and now i had bought and I'm upset very regretful that its packaging had changed (before packaging was including one metal box with ant audio stickers but now one plastic panel to hold earphone that's it)
Ant audio had the best packaging but now he lost respect and Goodwill from my side 

product quality is ok one side stopped working after 4 months .

Good

The tin box and stickers dident come in new box but sound and build quality is good

Best for bass and treble is low

All good as per there rate but the product packaging is show there is not give on ordering.

ery good quality earphones. However they could attract customers more if they could provide a case like previously they did. Though they cut the cost of metal case to improve the quality of earphones but in this price range many earphones are available and if ANT Audio wants to increase their market value they should do something exceptional.

This is the second time I am buying the same product when I bought it for the first time they were perfect so I ordered again but this time they sent me a defect piece it has damaged my opinion about ant

Bought it a year ago, initially it was working fine, i am not a music lover. I was using it only for meetings and calls.
But after 6 months it stopped working.

Warranty claim procedure is tedious as you have to register and log a ticket to acroma on their website.
than you have to take a ticket letter print which you will get on mail after raising complaint and than send product to them at ur cost with product.

Better check other options also in same range.

overall very average product, bass and noise cancellation is decent. But Geez!! Design is just so poor if you have comparatively small ears just go away dont look at this product again.

And i onething earphone is damaged among within one month. If you keep it with proper care then it is okay.

Worst experience with Amazon. Don't buy it from amazon. They delivered duplicate product.There is no Tin box available and the quality of earphone is extremely low as the sound quality. I have shared images above which is different from original packaging

It's better than boat but lacks crispness sound quality. At this price point, Blaupunkt is Big Boss Than any one else either sony,senessiner.
Harmonics frequency present in all way round. Still they need to design improvement.

Audio Quality: 1/5 (Tinny, high treble, zero bass sound. Bass kicks in only when one presses the earbuds inside the ears: as soon as you remove your hand, the earphones slide out.)


These are some good earphones with ultimate bass at its price . The also great as per its price ( almost same as boat Basshead 225) . The overall sound quality is also good . The bass is out standing its punchy and clear. Due to good bass lows and vocals are pretty normal but still they are very good . When compared to Boat Basshead 225 . Its much better . The packing is nice and quiet premium .The built quality is nice , tangal free cable and fully metallic design .Although the earbuds and the hook are of quite low quality when compared to Basshead , but overall its just amazing for its price range . The fit is quite nice and comfortable . I Will Definitely Recommend You To Try These , For bass lovers You Can't get better than these in this price rang !!!!!!!!!!

Waste product wire quality is not good.. earphones will not be like they shown in the pictures..if someone calls you they can't hear your voice heavy disturbance in mic... I ordered and return it back in 1 hour..not at all satisfied

I mean whenever I listen to a song, It disconnects and then reconnects by itself and it's really annoying! I'm telling you If you are looking for a headphone with good bass then this ain't for you man. don't waste your money. the only thing I liked about this product is stickers and that case lol.

Well Its been roughly three days since I bought this earphone. The build quality is terrible . Right out of box it felt like a cheap earphone. It's right ear just broke while I was listening to music and sleeping .

Good but one side stopped working after 8 9 months. Product was unsealed.

I'm disappointed. I expected good quality from this product but nope.
-Noise cancellation is bad
-Sound quality is not fine

My ratings are against the fact that how economical (499/-) these are for what they offer. I'm an Earphones enthusiast, so I bought this to just try out. I have used the Sennheiser CX180, Panasonic, Phillips SHE3900BK, Soundmagic E110c etc in my past. I currently rock the Mi YDJS01JY (the 999/- ones).

After 2 months of use i can say you won't find better headphone than this in this price range.i was looking for good headphon first i bought boat basshead 225 it was terrible experience so i return it then i bought MI basic but i was not satisfied so then. I saw this newly launched headphone. I was one of first 15 buyers of this product. Got it in 499rs in flash sale. It has everything u need. Excellent sound, awesome design. Clear sound on phone call, and last but not least ita packaging. Never seen this kind of packaging even in 2000rs headphone. Its include tin case, carry pouch. Blindly go for this. You won't regret.

Awesome Amazing Incredible. I had earlier used ant audio h56 and h82 so tried this this one as these were one of the cheapest available branded wired earphones. I git these at a price tag of 599 INR. Now let's come to review.

there is no bass ,nothing. Very much disapponted.

The bass output is good when listening to music. But very annoying during calls and gaming. And regarding noise cancellation- I don't think there is any. And I bought this earphones in the hope that it comes with the steel case. Because I saw it in the reviews. Same price but you're now getting a cheaper quality is how I feel.

While Amazon and the seller delivered the package on time and in a good condition, I'm really disappointed with the sound quality of these earphones.


Yes if you want raw Bass without considering quality of sound gonfor Ant audio else try Blaupunkt em10 for deep phenomenal bass.


I buy ant audio w56 earphone for listening lecture on YouTube but it has low clarity.
And when I was using to playing songs it gave only bass you can't listen longer.
I have lenovo vibe k5 plus mobile it has Dolby atmos driver so my mobile don't support this .
I also tried nokia phone only bass low clarity


the packaging has degraded now to normal Plastic packaging Not worth for 590+ Price. 

Product was not that great on sound quality, no exceptional bass and just regular sound. Crackling noise on call so ordered replacement which came as in pics with cuts on wire etc. basically a very old used product so dint even touch it and settled for refund.

Reviewing this product after complete burn in after a month or so. Incredible bass and treble. Excellent vocals. Lower end is good. Mid range and top end is comparable to Sony XB50 and slightely better than already exceptional XB30. Vocals are certainly not as great as Senheisser CX275 but then that one costs north of 1500 and is a benchmark for vocals in the lower spectrum of earphones.

If you want 'clarity' at a really low price then you will be much happier with the Samsung ehs64 than these.

The packaging of the earphones really impressed me. Initially I was a bit skeptical about the built quality but I then I was wrong.

Its been almost 2 months that I have been using this earphone and its durability has exceeded my expectations. It is one of the best earphones in this price bracket. I was earlier using the Boat Bassheads 225 but the Ant Audio has a slight edge over it. The earphones are lightweight with snug fit design.

Packaging - 5/5
Audio - 5/5
Bass Quality - 5/5
Mic - 3/5 (This could have been better. You have to hold the mic closer so that your voice is audible at the other end. Had the same issue with Boat Bassheads)
Build Quality - 5/5
Value for Money - 5/5
Overall - 4/5

One of the earpiece stopped working after 1 month. Customer care told me to send the product to their address. And I send. I send through Indian post and it shows they delivered at the same address. But Customer care guy is telling they didn't get the product. I tried 2,3 times and I understand that these are fraud guys. They just have a customer care number and will take the calls. But they will just cheat you.

I was surprised such cheap quality eartips are used on this. And I am confused literally every time which pair is left and which one is right. The 45 degree doesn't add anything it's a gimmick.

for the cost it seems good
built quality is good
sound is good all the frequencies are well produced 8/10
bass is adequate (no nonsense),
in comparing to jbl cs-100si the bass tightness is good in par
overall sound is good
hope it will last long, reliable.

Editing my review, after 3 years i had used 3 w56. Since in the middle I tried boat 225, couple of c100si, ant wave 702. But the best is w56. It's the most reliable, producing quality sound, good bass comparing to any head phone In this price range. Because of my rough usage ony the w56's cable went broken 3 times. Now the w56 is out of stock everywhere not sure what to buy another, I can even buy w56 for 1k since I know the quality.

Wire quality looks good. Bass doesn't feel that punchy.. It was second time when i returned Ant earphone and both within 2 days. Quality management is disastrous. They sent me an defective piece. How is that possible... Its horrible for a good company...

Received in as expected Tin box.
Packaging was good above expectations.
Plus timely 1 day delivery and price of 499/-. This deal is 10/10.
Coming to the product after using Sony ex150 and Sennheiser CX180 I can say it worth almost every penny.
Almost coz Eartips are quite hard.
It may dropped out while in motion.
A bit heavy but I think it's coz of my past 2 ultra light buds but will get use to it soon hopefully.
Sound is very good.
Especially clarity is 10 on 10.
Bad news for bass lovers not so heavy bass. 6.5-7/10 for that.
Mic is too good. Ultra HD voice 10/10.
Cable seems of very good quality should last 12-15 months easily with rough usage.
Over all I'm happy.
If you want even better one go for Boult pro bass Loop. It's magnetic and also has better audio output. Price is also same at present. Where it lacks is that it's bulky for small ears and feels heavy after merely an hour.

I bought this earphone and while hearing my ear got pain. Earpain i seen for all earphones (ant and boat) with this kind of flat wires due to heavy weight of earphone part. So i recommend to buy anti tangle wired earphone which are round and not flat. This earphones are good for music only. If you are taking this for cryatal clear call quality u may disappointed for having bass or teared voice. For music these are good earphones. For ear friendly voice, i was very comfortable with house of marley earphones.

Looks like an earphones bought at railway station. It's worth of 50rs. Sound quality wrost. Wanted to try new product and results were horrible. Please don't buy this product. Instead you can go for other earphones in yhe same price. Very disappoint.

Only problem is mic not working properly sometimes.

This was mine second headset...I had ordered it in 2019 and was working absolutely fine now same has stopped working hence ordered new....But as I received ordered it was like completely different packaging also package was open, spare ear cover missing no metal box also product seems duplicate....As checked audio it was completely pathetic one side earring was very low....I have returned replaced but replaced product is same as previous one....

 Within few days of usage, it became absolutely useless. Whenever I connect it with my MI-y1 mobile, it starts malfunctioning. While I run any media (YouTube, Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, Gaana.com, Wynk Music etc.) Volume control of the mobile starts jumping up & down without any reason, Google assistance opens up automatically and the running media pauses. 

This is a really great product that surpasses the jbl earphones at 800 or so price point in terms of sound quality. The bass is good but it bleeds when the volumes are raised. Good noise isolation. So if your budget is fixed around this price point, I'd recommend to go for it

The product was overall good but idk why but it doest fit my mobile phone's jack, getting disconnected again and again within seconds after adjusting it.


One of the best earphones probably even in 1000rs ballpark,I bought the Boult audio loop ​and returned it because of the over exaggerated bass and ok mids and lows,W56 reminds me of a version of Sennheiser Cx 180 with a little less clarity and better durability
​I'll breakdown the pros and cons here
PROS
• Flat and balanced audio
• Mids and lows are good
• Bass is adequate not booming(preferred)
• Good looking design and the fins help to
stay fit in your ears
• Flat cable and L shaped jack
• Feels premium for its price
CONS
• Packaging is cheap and different than its
shown here no stickers and metal box were
present ​and it was already dented
• Single button control(not a huge deal tho)
If you appreciate good mids and lows and adequate bass then this is the earphone for you.

Not perfect working neither understanding thing. Dont go for it . Only wastage of money and time there is no any services , we have to courier product for replacement itself if it will be defect or not working mostly its not perfect and getting off one side

Didn't even last a month. Even though the sound quality was pretty good for the price, the make was awful. The front part came off within a week and I had to glue it back. Also the mic didn't work properly and the earphone had to be plugged in and out to work properly. At last it stopped working exactly after a month's use.

Bass is not that good (you have to use bass boost to feel the bass lol)
Audio jack is trash (I'm using Samsung J7 and it's loose)

 I didn't got any metal box wih my package and also the product box sticker was already opened and the pin side seems to be damaged, requested for replacement

its a great earphone with high sound quality and clarity but users expecting tat punchy bass could be slightly disappointed. I was really disappointed with the packaging as i did not receive the metal casing as shown in pictures, instead i just received the earphones in a normal plastic cover. It was something disappointing for this price range and it seems like ant audio is dropping in its reputation:/

I didn't expected this from Amazon but this is quite common now. I got a used product. The seal of the box was already open and the sound quality is also not good as a new one. The left earpiece is also faulty. left earpiece is dead.

It was delivered in already used contidition, there were gross hairs on the buds, extra buds were missing one side was not working also the one working was very low sound quality. It was giving a buzz as soon as i plugged in. 

I bought it for 555. At this price this is really a good bargain! Quality of the product is good. However bass is too much. If you are a high bass lover then you'll definitely love it. But if you want to hear everything balanced. Then it might not be your taste.
But at this price I would say this is a good deal.
Pros-
1. Tangle free
2. Durable
3. Good packaging (comes with a case)
4. Heavy bass.

Cons-
1. Sounds are not clear due to extra bass.
2. You won't find that many ant audio stores. Thus if anything happens, it will be difficult to get it fixed or replaced.

First time I've tried Ant Audio Product... There's no any noise cancellation. Bass quality very low... Although i received a broken piece worst experience ever for earphones 

It's a value for money product. Got it for an amazing price. Sound quality is great, although the bass could have been better. But it is a nice product.

Its not original product and sound quality is very bad. The bass is very normal and treble is much more than bass. Its fulfilled product by Amazon but only earphone comes with packaging without Ear buds and other accessories are not given by the seller..please buy from official site...

They have reduced the price and compromised with the quality , I have been using this earphone for last 3 years and was very satisfied with sound quality and build so I decided to order the same earphone again as I was habituated with this one but trust me this new product are the worst very poor build won't recommend it anymore

Completely Garbage There was dust inside the earphone in all three of them when replaced still dust in those three earphones in the boxes

Everything is good notice cancellation bass quality n all ...except one thing it's bud always come out from the earphones I have to find it and put it again and again...I'm using this since 5 months and it is working verry good without any problem

The earphone is quite better thn its competitors. The siund quality is clear and crisp compare to boat 225 tbh i feel boat 225 sound is compressed and don't come out as clear as W56. The bass is deep and adequate this is what is good for listening music! Build quality is juss superb that's it. Noise cancellation is quite good. Mic is what i got dissatisfied works good but not best.

Over all quality is ok but I recieved a damage earphone in the beginning I thought I will manage but I now it is becoming very difficult to attach theam again and again.

Excellent product I've been using this for more than 1 year and I must say I never expected it to last that much but for my surprise it is still working fine.
The built quality is excellent.. I've used it as rough as I can .tangle free cables with angular pin works fine no tear anywhere on the cable.
Sound quality is good but not for bass heads.

Within one month of usage i got to know the built quality was so much cheaper than i thought. The thing which the earbuds are connected broke within 1 month both of them broke.

Amazing headphones I was sceptical at first considering i have never heard about the brand but i took my leap of faith and boy was it worth it the earphones are phenomenal. The audio quality is just crystal clear no muddling even at high volumes the mids were clear the high were not dead the bass was there but not overpowering

The only reason I bought these headphones is because I was trying to transition from boat bassheads 225 which are what most people like to compare this with. And so I'll tell what the difference in this one was. The unboxing experience was delightful as I received a tin box along with some contents unlike the bassheads which only give a small cardboad box.
The sound quality is not that admirable but considering the price it's pretty good
Although I still think that bassheads 225 have much fluent bass than these but these are not bad at all.
One thing I was annoyed by the bassheads were their metal Round shaped earpieces which were painful on my earlids. But these ones have an angular one so I'm good to go.
The wire used is untangeable. And the long gold plated 3.5mm jack these headphones were worth the money. Overall I think this is definitely the better choice for headphones than the Bassheads since they are super common and you can stand out in these.

 i found little different on sound quality (Low Bass) idk why brand doing this u can launch new model

Worst earphone first 1-2 month it is like cool but slowly it's sound quality is decrease and now it off from one side means one side not working

The sound quality is superb

dont buy this earphone. it is not good for casual listening. it is also not a durable , ear tip canal come out very quickly .

Package was already opened, then cam to sound tsting i used boat bassheads 225 for 3 years so i purchased this one but my god sound quality is simply terrible just like the earphones that are worth 50 to100 rs..highly disappointed.

One more thing to mention, it is build quality, it may get cut easily at its joints.
Only bass no clarity

The product I got has manufacturing defect... Left bud wasn't working. Otherwise noise isolation was well, I felt bass to be good but just by one ear. Smashed Refund within 10 minutes

This is just a basic earphones don't expect too much. I liked MI basic earphones over this with clear sound and bass quality.

I've ordered this.. First time it came as damaged one and I issued a return.. Second time it was again came with damaged earphone... I request not to buy this

These earphones are simply great...!! Do not even think twice before ordering. Amazon delivered it to me in free 1 day delivery through Prime.  Great sound...Amazing bass and treble balance for listening to all kinds of music. From EDM to soufi songs you can enjoy every single type...!!!
The wire length is truly amazing. Its really really lengthy so u can easily use it with a PC that is located at an arms distance.

Writing this review nearly after an year. Left side stopped working after 10 months. Mic also stopped working after 7 months. Fitting in ear is not that good. But the sound quality is good, bass is also good. Best noise cancelation in this budget.


Sure, the package and accessories are nice and so is their isolation I'll grant them that but they're not even comfortable no matter if you use the correct size tips for your ears.

1st of all the earphone box's seal was broken; when i connected the jack to my phone one side of earphone was not working, also there was some ear wax. I thought i bought a refurbished item mistakenly. But it is a new product with broken seal. Also it is the first time I got defective product on amazon.

Sound quality was ok for the price but the pain in ears these buds gave was so much that i had to return it. Because of the shape of the earbuds and ear tips the fit was not proper and bass was lacking. When i tried to adjust these in my ears, ear pain started. Will not recommend these.

Worst purchase ever. If you are into phone calls, never purchase this. This always comes with a radiation sound behind during calls. And the plug doesn't fit properly too. 

Replaced product is also faulty. Mic not working. VERY BAD product. After Amazon's return date passes the Ant Audio will ask you to courier the product by your own which is wasting of time and money. Throwing it in a dustbin. 

The microphone stopped working just one week after the purchase. The audio is alright bit the mic isn't picking any noise.

Great earphones, the build is strong, the sound quality is decent and the design is great. Heavy on the bass. The flat wire is an advantage as it doesn't tangle up much. Mic works fine. Unfortunately, it only lasted about 10 months for me until one side of the earphones stopped working. I'm an everyday user and even dropped these earphones quite often. It will be great for a normal usage.

One side of the ear piece fallen off within 20 days of careful use.. I bought it instead of boat but boat is better in terms of Quality and also sound.

good earphone

I don't even know whom to approach. I filled in a form online and there has been no response since


I was shocked to see the box and box content. One can easily say that the duplicate product was sent. 

The sound quality was goo but the one of earpiece was not working with in a month of purchase,.........better not go with it

Wires don't tangle much. Audio quality is good.For both gamers & music lovers. Wire length is very long,buds fit well in ear.

I use this product 1 month after time I was using it after month is stop working on left ear is speaker top working I am buy this product in October 2021 12 after one month stop working properly

Design: They fit very snugly in the ear. I don't need to twist or angle them a certain way to get the best fit and sound, nor re-adjust them periodically. They also have a good quality flat cord that resists tangles.

Sound: The sound is very good. They're tuned a little bit to the bass side, so rock and pop music sound the best. As for how much bass they provide, here's the important thing to understand: it depends on which of the included rubber earbuds you have on. Larger sizes will give you more bass because they'll seal off more of the ear canal. They ship with the medium-sized ones pre-attached. If you're a medium-sized person and not a fan of bass, leave those on. If, however, you want more bass, take them off and put on the largest size. It makes a big difference for me and I'm a relatively small guy. I suspect that some of the reviewers who have complained about these earphones not having enough bass didn't experiment with the other included earbuds.

Please be informed that this is a heavy bass headphone, so if you don't like that extra bass in everything, then don't buy it.

I liked the wire the audio jack and the bassy noice with sounc cancellation ..

And one of it's buds came off after few days and post that couriering of defective piece to the company for which you've too bear the cost takes around 25 days.

Earphone are not upto mark as compared to same earphones which I bought previously ..Above of all mic is not working...bad experience

PROS: The bass quality of the headset is quite good. Have missed those subtle sounds even on bit higher priced headsets. Thanks Amazon for delivering this well and quick. The box along with the headsets is quite handy and beautiful as well.

CONS: However the earbuds leaves some space for desire, the buds will tend to fall off if u are using it outdoor, and would also cause slight discomfort when used for longer duration. Had some spare earbuds from senneiser and replaced it with this. So no longer it gives discomfort.

Overall found it to be a good deal considering the price and overall experience.

Edits: Reducing 1 star as the earplug keeps dropping out of ears.

Pls Dont buy this product..rest its upon u..to listen or no. the worst product dont even work for 1 month

1st if you gonna buy this for its metallic case and stickers then don't buy it nothing was there in my product.


Initially the product quality is great and sound quality of the ear piece are also good, in fact the sound quality is quite good compared to Boat bass 225. Even though it feels tough cause of metal case it's a major disadvantage cause it tends to fell irritate if used for a longer period of time because of the weight. The base is good untill 60-70% of volume after that it becomes stight hard to hear. The vocals are clear, the instrumental sounds can also be heard clearly plus you'll get a travel case with the earphones which is made of aluminium so u can use it for anything . Over all it's a great buy within 600 bucks.

Sound quality very poor also build... It look like 50rs earphones. Where is amazon quality check department? Or amazon is selling this type of fake product???

 Product sent did not seem new and was not sitting in the packaging as shown in the review pictures. Noise cancellation : perfect, Sound Quality - Good , Bass: Good
Blend of sound quality and bass are in sync. No Screeching / connectivity disturbances. You won’t stop your fav song.
Purchase only if under Rs. 550 not worth spending more.

Cannot comment on the durability of the product.
Helping you to make a choice here on comparison - Ant Audio W56 Wired Metal is a better one to add to your cart (Let’s hope it’s not repacked)

If you want to spend a little more, the best & durable hear phones with or without mic are the Panasonic ones, speaking for the ones I personally tried :RPHJE125E-W nothing beats this piece however not seen it around for a reasonable price and the other one is RP-HJE118E-Y which was priced for Rs 499 when purchased in 2018. The W and Y is possibly for the color of the model.

I had some issues with first unit so I replaced it. The second one broke after 1 month. Audio only comes from one speaker now.

As a musician and a person who listens to music quite heavily, (an average of an hour or 2 a day) these earphones are alright. The sound quality is decent. Not very clear and bright. Bass is okay. Design is cool and tangle-free wires are a nice feature. I purchased this for a little over 500 rupees and honestly, for this price, it's a good earphone. If you want a premium sound quality I suggest you look into the Sennheiser or Sony earphones. They might cost 3 times the price of this one though.

Quality of speaker is good but socket is quiet tilt thats why not fixed properly in any phone, Due to this voice is bad in one speaker.

This headphone is a great headphone no debate in that build quality is good and bass is good too its overall a best deal for 700 rs but i dint like how the wire that connects to phone is sleeping connect which isnt ideal for people who like to hear and travel with mobile in pocket but does that make this headphone bad? no never its a better headphone to get at this price look forward on buying this wont regreat i can say that plus u get ant audio stickers XD that makes up for money(jocking)

And the bass OMG i was shocked
But the sadest thing is from last 7days one of my earphone is not working it was like heartburn please do have an solution for my concern my honest review
PLEASE HELP ME WITH THIS

It's been 8 months I'm using this earphone. I'll say this earphone is similar to that boat earphone which is of similar price range because I've used that also.
The two things I don't like about this earphone, first is at high volume high sound comes out of the earphone and second is earphone drops from your ear which is frustrating.
Sound, bass quality are good and noise cancellation is damn good.
I don't understand why there are rubber on each earphone earpiece they are useless.
There is one year warranty on this earphone and to claim warranty on valid reasons you have to fill details on the website acroma.com and you have to parcel the earphone to the given place.
I'll say don't spent money on this earphone, go with Mi earphone which is superb and its price is also less than this earphone.

It got uneven bass , like one side gives bass effect put other just plays plain sound , not satisfied.

Build quality wise this earphone is quite good with metallic build and good quality flat cables. Mic in this earphone is also good. It's provide good clear noiseless sound. Now comes to sound quality which is quite good considering the price. It's provide very good sound with good amount of bass. It's not too high though. Still Sound is clear and loud enough and it's definitely better than previous W55. So finally should you buy this. I'd say yes. It won't fall off easily while running or using in the gym. So it's very good fit for fitness enthusiasts. It produces very good sound in this budget which is loud enough and have good enough bass but not too high to overshadowed vocals.

I know the name sounds new and you have trust issues just as normal consumers. But being a musician, I would like to throw some light upon your earphones understanding. So Ant Audio is a robust powerhouse performer in the budget friendly earphones category I have seen yet. I would say the packaging and a small letter from the CEO makes the brand little more trustworthy. Talking about the features, the build quality is as good, in fact slightly better than boAt, flat long cable, eargo-fit earbuds design, and L shape gold plug is the best trio you get in any earphones. 

Even the warranty replacement i requested which didnt go well...when i requested for warranty they said that i must currier this earphones to the service center which would cost me more than the products price

I'm Liking everything about it and nothing disappointing about the product so far. Like the other's we're saying, the packaging is simply too attractive for the price and yet the best of all is the sick bass output and the metal finish.

As i mentioned 3rd time (why?) Because when i ordered them for first time it last long for only 8 months (because of my carelessness like pulling these from bag and pocket) one side stopped working then i claimed warranty but i need to send them through post office that was costing me 200 rupees and 40 days of time to receive them back but i liked them so much so i just ordered another one and after sometime i ordered 3rd one for my sister

It's been a month and for the price range this product is much more preferable over others. Sound quality is good and noise cancellation is pretty good too. When it comes to bass, if you're someone who's into EDM you'll be slightly disappointed when the beat is at high pitch as the it just seems like a blasting on few moments. Lil heavier buds but overall a 4/5 product. I got this for 500 bucks & unless your budget is over 1000 bucks this is the one earphones you should shoot for.

Left speaker and mic both stopped working after 2 month of moderate use. But another one, no use of sound quality or bass if the lifetime of product is hardly 1 month.


very very worst product poor quality plastic damaged at two side very easly within 3 days totally waste of money

Audio sounds way better through my Samsung HS-130. Can't return now as they have a 10 day return policy. Money wasted! Disappointed!

I had used the same product 2 years ago sounded good and came with a metal box but now the sound quality is horrible and quality feels different


Don't expect much from this brand. Sound quality lacks refinement. And please pay heed to desc. It's a 7 days replacement only.

Great sound but does not last long. Stopped working within warranty period got the replacement that also lasted only one month.

Being an audiophile, I couldn't stop myself from ordering this earphone because ever since i saw it on amazon, I was really tempted by the looks and the Positive customer feedbacks. So I waited for the best discount it would offer and brought it at ₹ 499. And man oh man I'm in love with it. I'd recommend this to anyone who is searching for a good earphone at a reasonably cheap price.

People now-a-days are really dumb they purchase earphone by company Which is famous for making smartphones (like mi, realme etc..) and they don't even know what real sound is best under 600 sound quality is awesome only con is hooks it should be permanently attached to the earphones 

Bad design. Bass verfy loud and damaging to the ear

The earphones are best under its price bracket buyed it for 479 in diwali sale.
But when I first time plug it in it has some irritating bass, so the thing I did and suggest you all that download a audio wizard and reduce bass to low level and then it turned out to be a beast. Its sound quality, vocals , treble all becomes beautiful when I reduce its bass. Its build quality is also superb and but sometimes feel little heavy. Can't comment about its life as I have just started using it.
But if it runs for 1 year or so then they are killer for its price

Build quality is also more than good. Most amazing part was packing. I have never seen any earphone packed as nicely as this one with this price.
I had a minor problem with ear birds. One of them was broken, but it's ok.

Stopped working after 4months
One side of earphone is been broken
I don't recommend buying wired earphones instead buy wireless bit costly but worth it

Sound quality is quite good.
Noise cancellation is good.
Bass quality is pretty good.
Build quality is awesome, according to it's price.
To sum up, if you see this product is with any casback/discount offer, grab it as soon as possible.

You can't reach to the warranty people. They simply register your case and do nothing about it. Then the update by canceling the request by their own. Acro RMA support is worse

I replaced two times before it complete 1 month of using. Performance is good, but it won't last. Go for boat or something, atleast you can use for 1 yr.

You are paying 500 to 800 rupees for it, you cant expect any more. But still, the false claim of sweat proof cant be tolerated. Jbl has far better headphones at this price point

I am reviewing this product after using it for 4 months. First i bought it, mic and audio control failed to work just within 3 days. I got it replaced within 10 days with a new pair.

Stopped working within 2 months. I didn't bother claiming warranty it was just that bad.

First of all the product is very durable it can withstand rough uses.
So the build quality is good now talking about the sound quality the vocals are good and bass is also good can be a little better but at a given price it's quite nice and the higher tones is also good. The only concern I have is the ear tips provided is not very comfortable I have to take out the ear hooks as well as the ear buds and mount my own to get it comfortable for daily uses otherwise great product from ent audio.

Only one thing that is good it's Made in India but product is not good

After 3 months, 1 side voice bud's are off don't buy

I loved these earphones the most in this price cause the bass and the treble, both are in level and the sound quality is just awesome.
The packaging is just WOW! Just incredible! The earphones comes in a metal box with the warranty card and the manual to use it safely with some extra ear plugs to properly fit in your ears to enjoy every beat of the music and last but not the least, it comes along with stickers also! You can use it to paste it on your smartphone or anywhere else, I loved the packaging the most along with this earphones! :)
But now comes the bad point and the reason why I didn't gave it 5 stars, the thing that I found frustrating is that the extra earplugs are not fitting in the earphones at all except the one that came already installed in it, it's really frustrating!
Other than that, these earphones are awesome and it looks to me that these earphones are going to last very long but I'm gonna have to wait and watch....:)

Sound quality is good packing is premium but no accessories and looks like a used

Everything was great right from anazon’s delivery and panctuality to product’s packaging.
Now regarding the product, within 500-600₹ its a good product adding the case provided. The pouch and extra earbuds aswell.
The only thing that could have been added is the volume fluctuation buttons on wierd mic. Also sometimes the audio feels a bit mono until you increase the volume much. You will feel the layers of instruments in your music when you increase the volume much.
Besides that the bass and treble both are equally balanced.
To check the caliber of this product try to listen “chale chalo” song from lagaan. It has everything a earphones can be checked upon. From bass beats to various layers of instruments to trebble to chorus.
Thanks Amazon, and Ant Audio aswell.

But if you have mi or Oppo which delivere Direc Audio driver provide mid clarity.
But this type of earphone you can purchase from mobile stores around 200₹ .
Simply say this earphone only for who love bass not music.

Using the same earphone from last 2 years (blue Color). Bought a new one at Rs 349. Earlier it was of Rs 500. I was having doubt about the quality but it was all right. But, the product I recieved is either the unboxed one or the refurbished one.
Keeping all aside, the product is good as similar to the old one.

Good bass and balanced treble, better than boat earphones that comes around this range but not up to that of JBL in terms of sound quality. Good material which is Tangle free.
Unfortunately one of the sides, sound quality get lowered after around 10 months and honestly thats only because of rough usage ( always fell down from heights ) and luckily it was within warrenty period and I claimed for warrenty @acrorma.in ,because of there is no physical damage I got the replaced product after a month from the courier date.
Good Service by acrorma.

The performance of this headphone is awesome but it keeps falling off from my ear. I was planning to give it to my friend because i was not able to use this properly. Then came the break i was looking for. For everyone who is having an issue of headphone not staying on your ear, can replace the default earbuds with a pair of foam earbuds which you can get for Rs20 off from aliexpress

Over all great product for this price
Fully satisfied with this product but they need to improve vocal for hearing YouTube content and bass should be improved Little bit.

Coming to the product, one of the earphones was not working. Disappointed. I placed the return request. Product was damaged but packaging was proper

Earphones are good with decent bass, highs and lows, sound and comfortable to hear.
Built quality is good with extra clip to hold earphones to shirt while using in journeys.
Extra earpieces are there - 2 pairs.
The earphones are so slippery but as there are earhooks, we could hold them better in ears.
The L shaped earphone jack is too lengthy which is somewhat discomfort to use for games playing like pubg.
There is box made of iron i think which is to store , that's a good part.
Overall these are very good in this price category.
I got it for 499.

Try someother

Stopped working in six months.
Really fragile. Won't recommend this to any user

Once there is issue with earphone, just forget it. There is no official service center anywhere except Delhi. You will have to raise a service request on portal online and then they will ask you to send your product to Delhi via courier and you have to spent cost for courier.

The sound increases by itself. Don't buy,

Firstly i want to tell about the Bass of W56 and it is mind blowing .
Actually that was the reason to purchasing And audio w 56
Now moving to sound quality it's a big mestry coz some phones having equalizer itself and some didn't have that
I'm using this W56 on my Asus Max pro m1 and Samsung S8 the sound quality is better on S8 than Asus and the bass is better on Asus
So Friends think on it before buying

***Note to Amazon - the carry case is not included in my package / that metal case ***

It comes in a box which contains a metal tin, inside the metal tin you get a warranty card, user welcome card, a pair of medium sized earbuds attached to the earphones and a pair of big and small sized buds with a pair of ear clips and and a clip to hold them to your shirt,talking about the quality,build quality is excellent, sound quality is excellent but when used with 'UHQ' upscaler, it leads to distortion

A must-buy product under 500 budget. The product is nice. Has a great sound in this price range. The metal carrying case not available as the company has discontinued it from the last year. Built quality is also good.

They are the best in the range, you should consider them fir good bass and mic. I only have one complaint that i did not get the iron box and the stickers.. They should give them

The sound quality is good same as the other product in this range, but the product design is very bad. Metal earbuds are too much heavy and the rubber clips are very much loose. The earbuds are coming down most of the time & few times I almost loose those rubber clips.

Close to 4yrs now, simply superb!!

Light weight: lighter than boat bass heads, you won't even feel them. Unlike bass heads, they don't fall off every now and then, so no hassle; they remain where they are.

good quality of sound and best ones for the price

Earphone jack worn out in 1 month,I couldn't hear things property even though both heads were working but I couldn't get the sound properly

Didn't last a year. Not gonna buy again.

Warranty clain is a joke.

After 3 months meant now if we connect it to our phone it's working normally for 15-20 min afterwards it automatically changes songs and Google assistant turns on YouTube turns on and whole chaos in Mobile

No Details At All. Only Reverbering Bass.
Nothing Else. Treable is Irritating, Not Balanced
At All.

The build is good and it is truly tangle free. I enjoyed good quality sound and calls for about 2-3 months 

Best in this price range

I liked the earphone but one thing is tht if u listen to full volume the sound is not upto the mark and not clearly audible.
The bass is very good and and the noise cancellation is very good...
But one thing is tht it is 'Made in China' product.
And in call the other person cannot hear me clearly don't know y but m not tht much satisfied with the product at which it is available...
In my opinion JBL woulb be a perfect choice.

My initial impression is that the build is solid and attractive, the bass is great, sound is loud but the vocals suffer at times.

 the storage box they come in should be useful, the earphone look cool, I got the green one.

sound is average but for price they are asking its good

I suggest you to never buy ant audio product as they look good and low in price too but after sales warranty service is worst of its kind

Preimum sound quality, full od bass , for a perfect earphones bit jack little bit but overall value for money

Audio quality is good but eartips are not good, plus mic doesn't work properly, the other person on the call is not able to hear anything.

This is just BASS empowered earphones for heavy bass listening. For clarity of lyrics and soft music this isn’t the appropriate one.

Ear ergonomics is poor. You cant fix in ear without given additional rubber type fit into the ear, it gives you pain after 15 mins.

Good quality in budget

Mic quality is worst.. When u are on call other side person can't listen u properly...it will sound like bad signal on FM.

sound ok but ear piece got broken in 6 days. Seems like it is made of poor plastic quality

OK product. Its only for those who buy earphones under 500.

he bass quality sucks, everything else is okay, lasted 4 months.. Not gonna buy it again

good earphones

Value for money

reat product and good sound quality.

Rich Feel Earphones

the 3.5mm Jack of this earphone was very loosely fitting in the phone.
it gets disconnected with a very slight pull on the Cable.

Average, nothing special about product to be mentioned. Does its job. That's all. Nothing special. Soumd is average

ANT W56 is lighter and fits in ear, which is a great advantage over the former one.

Considering their price, they perform pretty good. Bass is thumping and can create a good listining experience.

Earphone sound quality is very bad. when you hear any song it will painful for your ears. Cant fit in your ear, i tried with many my friends.It always falls down.Microphone quality is very bad.

Wow! Best ever for any under 2k earphones

Good. But feels hollow.. while vocal songs feel great. Hearing hip-hop songs gives a sound reproduction that feels like a Rs.100 buck cheap local earphones.

Doesn't fit well in ears. Design choices were stupid a d make the buds slippery.

Sound quality is worse. Many a times tou don't hear lyrics and medium volume

Pls don't buy this product.i didn't get metal box sound is little painful in ears in high volume no warrenty card in box.ant website not working. Don't but this go for boat basshead 225.


but when I plug it in my ear perfectly it is really uncomfortable and sound is not clear and the base is gone but when I plug it loosely it's performance is quite good... but not recommended from my side

Not happy with the product. The ear piece is heavy and while the music is off, you can hear the annoying sounds of wire grazing on your body. The sound causes headache and had to remove it if not using, so noise cancellation is not possible unless you are still as a statue. Not worth it. Disappointed.

Nice one. Still working and good for the budget earphones.

AFTER ABOUT A MONTH OF USE ONE SIDE OF PIECE STOPPED WORKING VERY LITTLE SOUND IS COMING FROM RIGHT SIDE LOOKING FOR REPLACEMENT

The ear pieces keeps falling even though there is a support given to it ...I guess it fits perfectly for some ears only.

I'm online shopper and not a frequent reviewer. But as a choosy buyer, after analysing for earphones on different brands on budget ₹500 I opted at last for this item. This mind blowing product force me to write this review. Dear music lovers, if your budget is under ₹500 this product is the best just go for it. You'll never find better than this product at this ranges. Tangle free, soothing sounds, noise cancelling, and packaging is really commendable.

This headphones has same built and sound quality as BoAt Bassheads 225, only branding is different. Plus the packaging was just great.

Sound is excellent and bass is strong. Comfort is slightly comprised to keep up with the looks.

Decent product not too good seeing the price range, you can get better products, I don't know if I have got a defective product but the bass and the sound quality was way under par contradictory to the reviews I read. Bass was not on point noise cancellation is very good.

Best product. But you have to take good care of them for long lifespan

Well they stopped working after 2 or 3 month but they sound amazing before that and no way to get warranty

Do not buy.
Within four days it started producing static noises when plugged into the phone.
In Mic also works whenever it wants to. Never works when needed.

Crystal clear sound good for calling purpose

Super product at this price range....Voice clarity is excellent....desent super bass high mid and low are perfectly balanced.....so that overall music hearing will be very pleasure.....I owned many other brand earphones then reviewing this.....I am a base lover so in my view its not an extra bass earphone but decent quality good bass because of its well balanced audio.....Tangle free wire....Quality build....wire splitter and mic is made of metal.....Ant audio logo is printed nicely in that.....Ear piece is also made of metal i think its aluminium.....Ear clip is provided but i think its not necessary because its light weight and i can bet u that u cannot feel the earpice in your ear......Very light and soft.....long time use is not disturbing u will forget its in your ear.....but one thing is its sometimes fall from ear...... Nice packaging aluminium box.....Surprise is that Stickers are inside the box u can stick it in phone or somewhere else.....Ant audio logo i like very much..... Wire clip and extra buds are provided in the box.....Overall i love this product....i owned audio technica and rock its all extra bass and well balanced but price is also high.

I am writing this after using it for 1 year.
I am using it for 1 year and the quality is voice is still the same. Earlier they use to give very cool Tin box which was fab and now when i bought it again, it was jst like chinese box.
yes this is made in china although ANT AUDIO is UK based brand.
Overall a good choice with good wire quality

Not even worth for 300rs.. once again I'm telling you, never buy this crap.

while wearing helmet they become truly Uncomfortable as I like to put earphones on while driving.

Not that good. Very poor quality. Never ever buy this earphones

Okay so I'm a pro musician so unlike the general public I knew what I want from a headphone/earphone. Just received it today couldn't wait anymore longer to write a review.
Pros
1. The material and design can be said to be a step higher compared to the other brands
2. The packing is also quite impressive, not like other brands who simply put it in a box and send it
3. The actual thing everyone wants is the sound quality. Trust me as a pro musician I've come across such brands which produce exceptional sound and this little earphone comes into that category. The bass is no doubt sounds amazing but I would also say just on the basis of a day's use it also provides noise cancelation to some extent

Cons
1. As every person has a different ear, for mine I wasn't so comfortable to wear it as it kept coming out at some point so fitting was an issue
2. Due to extreme bass this little guy has, I won't say the music is crispy or crystal clear but yes you can very much get a pleasing audio

Overall, had read it in one of the earlier reviews, "A one stop destination for a perfect earphone"!

Earphones are not fitting to phone properly and lot of discomfort due to this.


Raw Bass,better than boAt but lacks quality sound. Sturdy design, Bass felt in high volume >70%, and with this total loudness increases which makes ear painfull.


Nothing to say rs 50 item paked labled don't talk about bass.


I genuinely hooked with this headphone....best bass boosted headphones ever used at such a great price...i have started with this headphone for some reason I lost my first pair of this headphones so i tried other brands also but not got this much satisfaction so i bought this pair of headphone and trust me it worth more than money u r paying.

Build is too good for the price and 45° turn enhances the ergonomics. Large size earbuds are a perfect fit for my ears and poweramp makes listening to any kind of music heavenly. They completely annihilate the competition even if priced over 1000. I have no words to describe how good they are at 399 for which i got these. No point buying Sony and Senheisser 

I like the head set and the bass is excellent but if you are speaking someone 

Overall the earphone is okay okay, the treble and vocals are balanced but if you want bass then it is not sufficient for bass.

Medium bass

Sound is quite bassy but not such deep bass,vocals are suppressed and at higher volume shrillness cause harse and pain in ear,metal earbud is feels heavy,eartip and wire quality is cheap not reliable,don't expect too much Boult loop<antaudio w56<realme buds 2

1st if you gonna buy this for its metallic case

it was good until I find out the earphone jack was loose.

This earphones are good i used it before but and its durable too

I had used the same product 2 years ago sounded good and came with a metal box 

its a nice bass earphones but wire was not much good so it didn't survive long

Yes if you want raw Bass without considering quality of sound gonfor Ant audio else try Blaupunkt em10 for deep phenomenal bass.

Everything is ok except the fit. Pains after 1 hour of use

Build quality is quite good.

Sound can go very loud and it's clear. Bass is there but its effect is not that clear. Build quality is good as it's wire is flat and casing is of metal.

Otherwise product is awesome and best quality material.

I have used this earphone for 5 months and replaced it two times. Its durability is not good as I used their earphones two time and both times it made a blurry sound afer a max 2-3 months of use.

Sound quality and durability its good considering the price

Nice product but compare to this price bass and sound quality is okay okay.

I loved the sound quality this earphone provided me. Expected some more bass but is good for gaming. Built quality should be improved

 Sound is great but the earbuds seem heavy and keep coming out despite trying different sizes.

Over all Ant Audio w56 is a good purchase but not the best.

Average quality

Earphones are goods if you are looking for music.

Superb sound Quality with bass.Ant audio > boat bassheads225 all respects

Everything is good not great

Extreme sound quality and the extra thumping bass was awesome

I've been using earphones for more than a decade now and have had Several, Panasonic, Sony and, Skullcandy. This one was not for me but a friend. And since I'm an audiophile, I prefer power output in terms of dB. Without a doubt this one is good by far but if I compare it with others, Skullcandy Smoking Buds 2 and Sennheiser cx 180 are a better option than this.

The issue with Ant Audio earphone is that it doesn't deliver that much of bass. It has clarity but nothing like Skullcandy or Sennheiser and that's my choice above all.

very good

Vera level product verithanama iruku bass la bayangarama iruku iam using for 6months .it is greater than boat .at this price worth buying.thank me later.

It's been over a year and still working like a charm best earphones at this price. Bass is good, treble is not too high and noise cancellation is also pretty good. And im thinking to take another piece of this now

Thank you very much Amazon for giving such a premium earphone at low price.

Its really good.... if u r a bass lover, go for it... its really amazing

i genuinelly hooked with this headphone....best bass bosted hedphones ever used at such a great price...i have started with this headphone for some reason i lost my first pair of this headphones so i tried other brands also but not got this much satisfaction so i bought this pair of headphone and trust me it worth more than money u r paying

It's unbelievable sooper good sound quality,Beutiful good good good good good good good good good good good

It is an earphone which deserves 5 star rating. The W56 is THE BEST in this price range apart from other earphones. Before this, I was using Boat Bass Head 225 and that too was nice but, if I compare Ant with Boat then no doubt in every parameter the Ant is far much better than Boat. 

I am using this earphone over 1.5 year,
Still overall quality is best in this segment.
Believe me you would not get better performance in this segment,
In one word it is best.
I am also using boat bassheas 225, it is heavy in weight but you can consider.
I have also claimed warranty once,
Customer service is also good.

Even if this is tangle free device. But still it used to tangle. I faced the regular headphone issue, one side down while other working..


Most Irritating Sound Ever.
I have used JBL C150SI, JBL C200SI, 1More Piston and Boat Basshead 100(Rs399) in the past. Coming to Ant Audio W56
 Flat Tangled Cable
Only Bass that too Over Powered. It starts
to distort even at 50% Volume even for
320KBPS Songs.

I would be more happy to use if the ear tips were comfortable.
Bad product

Very good quality earphones. However they could attract customers more if they could provide a case like previously they did. Though they cut the cost of metal case to improve the quality of earphones but in this price range many earphones are available and if ANT Audio wants to increase their market value they should do something exceptional.

Build quality is amazing. Earbuds are tilted at 45° so they doesn't get off from ears easily. Wire is flat and tangle free and it's very strong. Audio jack is at 90° and also gold plated. sound is one of the best part of this earphones. These Earphones comes with a superb bass experience. And the best part is it synchronises with low and highs. You get to hear each part of the music perfectly. Left and right sound detection is great when it comes to playing pubg. Vocals are also perfect. In final, these are the best earphones at this price range. Much much better than senheiser cx180 and JBL.

The build quality is solid, call quality is good, but, and this is a big one, there is a persistent static noise at lower volumes in this earphone. I don't listen to music on very loud volumes and usually listen to everything on volume level one. It is highly distracting therefore to have constant buzzing which starts as soon as you start to play anything and lingers for a while after the music has stopped. 

Every thing is nice in this product, the box is really good and strong even I am using this(box) perfectly after 1.5 months though the earphones are not working now and I am now shifted to realme buds 2. The earphones worked very well for 5 months but afterwards left earpiece stopped working and after 4 more months the right one also did the same thing and then it was of no use and complete waste for me. But it was worth buying because of that good quality box with it.

This is the best earphone one can buy.. material quality, design are superb. Sound quality is phenomenal.. and d packaging.. wat shud i say.. u cant imagine that a 500rs earphone can have a packaging like dat.. u won't just love the earphone u will hold onto d packaging too.. 

The seal was already broken . And it's looking like second hand

I listened indhira logathu song from 2.O (a tamil movie) in musicolet app.(we can boost bass in this app) probably, you guys know that, we usually check the quality of any headset with Rahman songs only (even we are Ilayaraja fan). believe me, this is the best headset ever I've been used.

I saw these earphones were available for 500 bucks and reading all the good reviews i just picked it up. These are just junk. Please don't waste your money on this product. The sound quality is extremely bad the mids highs and lows sound like three different parts making any song sound like sh*t.

Overall nice ear phone at this price range and quality of the earphones were awesome. I can recommend these earphones to all type of users....

Got this product delivered by amazon on 11-01-2019. My one side ear phone stopped within 16 days. Unfortunately I am unable to return the product. Now I have raised a warrenty claim. Worst part is service center in Delhi hence I have to courier the product to get it REPAIRED. 

The worst product ever..... One side ear stopped working in just 5 months .... Though its in warranty period i registered the complain in the website as well as i called the no. Which is goven below in warranty information...... But that stupid fellow never picks up the phone ..... Complete waste of money

Most amazing part is they can reject you claim after they receive your product. Basically you might lose you 150-200/- more and will get nothing.

Don't buy after 3 months it will not work

Realme products are much better than this and which are available in similar price range.


 Noticeable difference in weight and overall build quality than older ones. Tip of the right earbud just fall off after one week. Audio quality has dropped significantly compared to older versions of the same model, with no punchier bass, and clear sound separation.

no bass
-tinny sound
if you love bass and depth in your music buy skullcandy they never disappoint

I was using Skullcandy Smokin Buds 2 for the last one year and when they stopped working my friend suggested me to buy these and let me tell you after using skullcandy earphones these sounded like total crap.

 A sticker pack! For pasting on your laptop or mobile. About durability i ll definitely post within a year. But happy buying. This is worth trying.

After using 2 months the microphone stop working, I bought this product after going through the reviews on YouTube but i did not satisfy with the product sound is quite heavy aftet listening music for some time your ear starts paining

No shipping service from company when earphones get any fault mine one get one earplug low sound after 15 days of use.i don't know whether they changed this policy or not

the most important part Costumer disappoints in the first place with its packaging. Noise cancellation is cheap, sound quality is just average, and bass is high. I had very high expectations on this after seeing many reviews in YouTube.

It was working fine and the sound quality was good initially but after one month the right ear piece started producing distortion while playing music or while playing movie. Moreover there is no response from the company when i raised a complaint about the faulty headphone i had received. 

Stopped working after 3 weeks. And also misfunctions a lot. Terrible product

Got the product on correct date.But packaging was very bad.The amazon cover had a hole when i recieved it.Like someone did it to know what is inside..The earphone was in a steel type box.but the wire was jammed in between the steel box. Resulted in making a jammed mark on the earphone wire.Was afraid about this .but when i tested the earphone it was working.Earphone looks good. Was disappointed in the packaging and handling of the product.

Purchased in 2019, still sounds great except the mic got spoiled. But in terms of sound quality, this is the best I've used in this price range. I have used Boult loop, Boat 103 bassheads and have to say that this is the best I've used till date. Sound is dynamic, bassy and has depth into it, like its coming from a large room.

The sad thing of that headphone is, it's wire break from the mic in a 10 days. Very bad build quality of product and very low bass quality in this price range. The company only marketing that product by a different colors and attractive packaging otherwise the product is totally waste. Please don't fool by seeing the other people's high rated review. 

I bought this(green colour) in nov 2020(delivered on 6th nov)..
Earphones are value for money.

My review on build and sound quality :-
1. Build quality - I liked it, easy to put in ear and wire seems to be tangle free. If you are on bed in sleeping position, just be a little careful while turning your side as buds are medium in size not as small as senhizer cx 180 but still comfortable if not used harshly.
Appropriate for the price.
Wire - 9/10
Ear fitting - 8/10

2. Sound quality - One will experience awesome sound if the device supports dloby atmos as bass is finely tuned. So this earphone is one of the best with dolby atmos, all you need is a basic google music player and dolby atmos as equaliser, cheers!!
Bass - 9/10
Noise cancellation - 8/10
Sound quality - 8.5/10

Overall this product is value for money and it's comes 2nd in my list after senhizer cx180 if the budget is below 800rs.

Sound quality is good not best for those who want all sound equally balanced i.e bass, mid, and treble.
For gamer and musicians it ok ok type.

Build quality packaging everything was perfect except sound my ear starts paining because of loud screechy treble...

Dont confuse sound isolation for cancellation it has amazing isolation and the sound is good suitable for most uses .Cons- Very delicate wire quality needs to be handled with care.

Last time I gave 5* now I'm taking back to *is not worthy! Previously I used BOAT I THINK THOSE ARE BETTER THAN THIS!!

It's pathetic!!! It's just 3 months I have bought this earphones..and one head phone is not working.. It has one year of Warranty and from last 2 weeks I am trying to get through the ant audio issue related available contact via calls and messages on WhatsApp bt there is no response and guidance!!!!

If you're some schmuck who just loves having tinnitus-inducing levels of "extra bass" then you should go for these.

I love the sound quality this earphone provides. The bass in this one is too damn good. Manages to cancel noise to a great extent. I'd recommend this to those who're looking for quality earphones within the economic price range. I have been using this only for two weeks so I can't comment on the durability of this product so I would suggest to everyone to check the other 

I have been using this headphone with care but eventually, one of the speakers is no longer working. It's like if I wiggle the wire, it will work but not for long. These headphones really don't even have a year of life span. At the end of the day, you're just paying pretty pricey! Never ever gonna try to buy again from this company. 

Just received my 3rd ant audio earphone.The first one worked fine but ultimately it's microphone stopped working (maybe due to it's use in gym) after a few months. It was easily replaced by the company,thanks to the one year warranty but still the microphone had the same fate.Would recommend the company to improve the microphone's durability.
Otherwise in terms of sound quality,it stands out for its price. Brands like Sony,JBL,Boat doesn't match up when it comes to such audio quality at such a competitive price.

It is a good product with nice sound quality and noise cancellation and good bass
But the thing is the wire is totally tangled at the time of delivery and I feel a bit delicate which can be torn off
Finally worthy product

This is one of the best mid range headphones it bought till date. Bass is awesome, noise cancellation is good compared to the price point. Good for listening Rock, Hiphop and pop genres. Don't buy this if you are a classical /country lover.

I have purchased after seeing the reviews but "please don't believe in reviews", I think people who has given good reviews they have not seen so many headphones under this price range or they really don't know how performance is to be for this price range, it has no bass ,poor sound quality, it has only high volume I think most of the people miss under stood the difference between high bass and high volume..
